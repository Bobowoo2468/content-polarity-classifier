0,is it murder
1,lets kill these fetuses just because
2,its inside of you doesnt give you the
3,right to terminate it how about in the
4,case of the r word they call it the gift
5,of life because it doesnt seem like a
6,gift in that case youre not speaking
7,from the bible youre speaking from
8,opinion thats your only argument thats
9,some weak ass expletive right there funny
10,thing is these questions are stupid i
11,asked people on both sides of the
12,abortion debate and challenged each with
13,questions the other side may ask now
14,more than ever i thought it was
15,important to facilitate genuine
16,conversation but first heres some quick
17,context of what happened in <number> the
18,supreme court case of roe versus wade
19,ruled on the right to abortion
20,nationwide but now the case has been
21,overturned making it a state by state
22,issue paving the way for likely <number>
23,states to ban abortion so now lets get
24,into it why do you believe in your
25,stance what what happened today was
26,victory ultimately for anyone who has a
27,life and thats everyone finally dude we
28,all really were hoping that womens
29,rights would get taken away anyway
30,thats why youre celebrating tonight
31,right oh yeah dude im partying im just
32,like i want to go full term anytime i
33,bust gives the supreme court room to
34,potentially overturn other things and as
35,a queer woman if obergefell was
36,overturned maybe im getting this
37,message that im less than i understand
38,the perspective of my body my choice i
39,disagree with the sentiment that an
40,abortion is healthcare this isnt a
41,third world country contraception is not
42,expensive its not hard to come by if
43,you dont want a baby have safe sex i
44,actually grew up very christian though i
45,wouldnt do it it should be a choice for
46,someone else this is america and its
47,supposed to be the land of the free but
48,i just dont think its free anymore for
49,the people who dont understand sarcasm
50,what are your actual beliefs
51,no one wants this theres two types of
52,black people
53,what is no issues black or white i want
54,to get to the bottom of why people
55,believe what they believe and explore
56,the nuances within each side how much of
57,your stance in this case is dictated by
58,your religious beliefs very little my
59,parents are christian but its not about
60,religion for me it definitely weighs in
61,heavily i dont believe god put that
62,seed in that womb just to be like uh
63,yeah you can choose if you want to like
64,let it live or not i dont think thats
65,our choice to make very blessed to have
66,a mother and a father who to teach me
67,from right and wrong so ive been very
68,responsible with myself but what if not
69,everyones also blessed with twoparent
70,households which is a huge advantage
71,dont you think its also kind of easy
72,to say that if you do have a twoparent
73,house like i do too when youre not in a
74,position to accept that or not have that
75,support i think you have to find it
76,elsewhere right theres the internet
77,rights i mean <number>yearolds are on
78,ticktock probably a lot of ash taking a
79,lot of things of that nature life begins
80,at conception well i dont think that
81,you can argue oh im just destroying a
82,clump of cells youre killing an actual
83,baby and just because its inside of you
84,doesnt give you the right to terminate
85,it i mean im guessing youre not a
86,virgin right okay
87,congrats
88,im sure youve had sex before marriage
89,right
90,isnt that kind of going against your
91,religious beliefs as well of course bro
92,but the thing is isnt that a little bit
93,like picking and choosing them so i mean
94,everyones a sinner everyones gonna
95,make mistakes and no one sin is greater
96,than another it is a sin that im not
97,super proud about but you know life
98,happens you got to keep going i think
99,theres a clear line between eggs
100,fertilization and life those idiots
101,jerking off in the room thats not life
102,man theyre not creating nothing in
103,there sex is not meant to be for fun
104,like sex is for reproduction so then
105,what do the prochoicers think when does
106,a person become a person i think the
107,heart starts beating at six weeks
108,i would say after birth um when they
109,come out of the womb when they breathe
110,air as soon as you the reading on the
111,sticks says pregnant then thats life oh
112,now they got two kids like my position
113,has shifted a little bit <number> years ago so
114,i would have just gone along with the
115,viability standard another thing that
116,gets lost is that people that are
117,against abortions talk about it they
118,trivialize the decision a lot where they
119,try to demonize the person getting their
120,abortion thats not a decision that
121,anyone would take lightly dude youre
122,asking the dumbest expletive alive
123,about some well im gonna have a hot
124,take youre like actually at six to <number>
125,weeks suggesting no you just want women
126,to have rights over their bodies and
127,thats it but should there be a cut off
128,on when its too late i dont know its
129,its hard how about if its like
130,literally like a week before at that
131,point just put the kid up for adoption
132,if their doctor thinks its safe enough
133,to perform an abortion
134,how about after its born no but as soon
135,as it starts resembling a person i think
136,wouldnt be so easy anymore so with all
137,these different opinions on life i
138,wanted to ask is it murder its
139,definitely killing life do you think
140,thats morally right its wrong to do so
141,and its wrong to like make a law about
142,it okay so youre saying its morally
143,wrong to do abortion but you support it
144,now lets switch it back to the
145,prolifers shouldnt it be the
146,individuals choice what do you think
147,about womens rights and their freedom
148,to choose what they want to do with the
149,body this isnt a debate about womens
150,rights this is a debate about a fetuss
151,rights theyre saying its selfish
152,towards them but its really selfish
153,towards the life that could possibly be
154,at this point theres some viewers
155,probably thinking why are you even
156,asking men what do you think about
157,people when they say that men shouldnt
158,talk about this issue okay well i mean
159,maybe thats like the single dab i mean
160,yeah maybe i could have said that if you
161,caught me friday night <number> years ago
162,right i mean everyones born with a
163,father and mother so you should consider
164,it and so
165,should fathers have equal say in whether
166,a woman should get an abortion or not no
167,but in this case isnt it you need both
168,to create a baby right yeah but the
169,mans body isnt affected at all and so
170,i dont think that they should have
171,equal say into what is happening with
172,another persons body im terrified of
173,giving birth the biological father maybe
174,shouldnt have a stance i mean right i
175,dont know yeah if i was just a guy
176,whos like dude i expletive came in you
177,and you know what i got a lot to say
178,about it get out of here thats nice
179,wait i do have my gun on me and i will
180,shoot anyone including school children
181,so you do like murder a lot huh i love
182,you dudes are consistent different
183,perspectives equate to different
184,opinions but what doesnt make sense are
185,the inconsistencies on both sides did
186,you support strongly recommended
187,vaccinations if i choose not to have a
188,baby who else am i affecting for someone
189,whos prolife the life that got killed
190,okay i mean i think this is a fair point
191,i chose not to choose the <number> and it cost
192,me kind of like my job the same thing
193,with abortion in a sense right if you
194,choose not to get backs youre affecting
195,multiple people around does that change
196,anything feels selfish in a way right
197,okay
198,obviously its a huge generalization but
199,usually those who supported the mandate
200,are now protesting for my body my choice
201,while the other side was arguing for my
202,body my choice on the mandate until it
203,was about this issue on abortion
204,so now lets take it up a notch to
205,really understand their beliefs how
206,about in the case of lets say the r
207,word
208,youve got to make exceptions for
209,exceptional circumstances thats your
210,only argument thats some weak ass expletive
211,right there they call it the gift of
212,life because it doesnt seem like a gift
213,in that case right youre right when
214,theres life theres potential for good
215,youre a child of a mother but then you
216,have an opportunity to go out and make a
217,difference and say hey i became x and y
218,and z and gave their all in everything
219,in life i think that we as a society
220,would be better give me the pain give me
221,the suffering
222,lets power through it and lets become
223,better and harder and callous
224,individuals because of it
225,expletivelaughter
226,sorry sorry
227,but are we putting the focus on the
228,wrong thing do you think that adoption
229,should be prioritized more than abortion
230,america has not fixed our foster
231,adoption system many children that are
232,in abusive homes im adopted i was
233,adopted four days old adoptions a much
234,better route i want less people why do
235,you want less people oh the freeway
236,opens up lets kill these fetuses but if
237,they could what would they say about
238,each other have an open mind and dont
239,be that prolife person that says oh
240,youre gonna go to hell youre not
241,speaking from the bible youre speaking
242,from opinion you know damn well the
243,risks just to sacrifice a life because
244,of your poor judgment making is
245,unacceptable i definitely get its like
246,okay thats a person but your expletive ends
247,when its like all right well im gonna
248,tell you what to do with your own body
249,is there <number> i think million abortions
250,that have been since the 1960s so youre
251,going to sit here and tell me i have <number>
252,million brothers and sisters that im
253,supposed to be hanging out with right
254,now and make memories with and theyre
255,not here its sad and it gets me
256,emotional man thats like theres
257,theres thank you so much to my brothers
258,and sisters for watching so far
259,sorry sorry no matter what side youre
260,on beware of the person who masquerades
261,closedmindedness as acceptance which is
262,exactly what i experienced with the
263,protest ill get to why shes blurred
264,out but during the interview she
265,mentioned how the other side needs to
266,have more empathy for her side and i
267,challenge her that it actually goes both
268,ways but then she proceed to argue that
269,she doesnt need to show empathy for
270,them and essentially calling them idiots
271,then another protester saw the interview
272,and started confronting me asking why i
273,was challenging her and why i wasnt
274,showing my support with a sign one thing
275,led to another and the protester and the
276,girl that i was interviewing started
277,yelling at each other and argued so i
278,decided to leave and a few minutes later
279,i get this dm do not use a single piece
280,of that footage you took of me i dont
281,consent to you using it anymore made me
282,look like a expletive fool then run away
283,like a expletive
284,bet delete it gotta say those are some
285,harsh words from an empath holding a
286,sign or posting an instagram story
287,doesnt make you openminded and neither
288,does just talking to people you agree
289,with vilifying the opposition is a lazy
290,copout to avoid conversation and
291,critical thought and if empathy no
292,longer means considering others
293,experiences maybe the last thing our
294,country needs is more empaths
