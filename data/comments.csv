0,what yall think about this topic lets start a thread below and for more frequent uploads check out my second channel gen+
1,live laugh love bestie
2,we should focus more on a|ready born children weve been kinda neg|ecting those
3,this
4,if were all for equality and opportunity and prochoice isnt abortion taking away that opportunity and choice from the unborn baby and if that makes you feel like that takes away your choice to have an abortion i understand but the thing is you already chose <number> months ago when you had sex
5,doesnt the legal system require a document proving citizenship ie birth certificate so when does a baby become a human at conception or separation from the mothers body if we want to consider the fetus as a life shouldnt we change the legal system to reflect that or at least debate on when a human life begins legally
6,the legal system does to some degree murderingkilling a pregnant woman is considered a double homicide
7,i looove when people say you dont get to terminate your pregnancy because you were irresponsible yet there are wayyy more people who got pregnant while using protection me included no one thinks getting an abortion is fun especially when you want to do it as soon as you realize youre pregnant to be as responsible as possible for your prevention failing yet have people acting like youre aborting a <number> month old fetus for fun
8,only when the pregnant woman wants to keep the baby and isnt planning for an abortion i assume dont think they make it count when a woman is like a month pregnant and has an abortion scheduled
9,i dont the law in too much detail unfortunately my only criticism to your thought in my opinion it would still count as double homicide if someone plans to kill someone else and a third person kills both the target and the person who planned to kill the other person the actual killer would still have killed the two people i dont know if thats how the law actually works i think it would be stupid if it didnt work that way
10,abortion waste resources like future labor and production for a nation
11,vilifying the opposition is a lazy cop out to avoid conversation and critical thought and thats a subscribe right there
12,same
13,yes thats exactly what happened here
14,absolute w
15,sometimes sides are advocating legitimately villainous behavior or no that never happens
16,what
17,but sometimes boiling it down to sides discourages actual conversation meant to find truth you can definitely call out people that are exhibiting villainous behaviors but you cant group in everyone else who might have a similar belief or who are on the same side
18,love your style not arguing and keeping it without a bias something the government seems to need a lot more lol
19,but you do realise murder is different from theft and pleasure both murder and theft are punishable and cant be normalised so for someone to think its ok to abort a baby is wrong and for someone to fornicate is also wrong abortion is wrong unless its at the expense of the mothers life
20,your the exact reason this world has a problem when somone says something even if its not what you disagree with you need to state your opinion without seeing the other side
21,bro where did i disagree with someone
22,eh abortion is ok if there is a way to make it a painless experience for the fetus my stance comes from consequentialism a baby that no one wants willingly being aborted by its own mother wont affect society in any way shape or form that way there is no stale mate with opinions
23,there is bias when he mocks the religious guy
24,eh i mean if the father wants to raise the kid then let the father have em if neither want to raise the kid then abort if its at the expense of mother life abort
25,the world needs your videos in my opinion we just need a way to make em see them
26,best comment ive seen yet thanks for watching and supporting
27,no it doesnt he brings people who dehumanise me and believe that i shouldnt have my basic human rights and im supposed to be kind to them and listen to their point of view bore off
28,well if thats what you belief good for you in my opinion in this video he objectivly gives everyone the right to speak their mind voice their opinion by having different views on the topic in the video he makes room for a conversation to be held about it without neglecting one side that is what i think the world needs
29,he addressed it in the video but being close minded is something that slows the process of understanding and finding some middle ground with the other side
30,the next video should be should men have the right to optout of parenthood before the baby is born i bet most women will say no
31,keep up the great content your documentaries are awsome
32,proboth made me laugh hard
33,i am proboth
34,how in ur opinion should abortions be allowed or not
35,i have listen to both conversations of the pro life and pro choice and i understand and agree with both and i cant really choose a side bc of that
36,im pro both from a philosophical standpoint you should choose what you want to do with your own body but on the contrary even if the baby is a clump of cells it cannot decide whether to live or not and the mother is making this decision on her behalf fetuses should also have the right to life as well imo
37,im also probothi understand that abortions can potentially kill the mother or make it difficult for her to give birth in future but i also understand that having a child youre unprepared for can set you backyou might be disownedyou might have to raise the child alonethe child may be a product of rape and you have to remember what happened everytime you look at the child
38,keep doing this its great to see someone see the hypocrisy in both these discussions need to have nuance but many people just tend to tick the tribal boxes rather than understanding the actual arguments
39,fetus
40,what the difference between a fetus and a baby
41,a baby has been born a fetus has not thats the scientific definition
42,my hair is also human life but you arent going to call me a murderer if i get a haircut human life isnt as precious as you think it is
43,the value of a human life is extremely subjective too
44,agreed but that usually depends on someones environment that they grow up in so that isnt a very strong argument for being prochoice
45,morally it maybe wrong but the key thing i dislike is the legislation behind it it shouldnt be illegal this isnt something that would affect me at all but i dislike laws that govern others in a way that limits their freedoms people that are generally prolife tend to come from more religious backgrounds so theres that as well as a whole the government should be completely secular with no religious influences
46,agreed
47,the lack of intellectual consistency on both sides is pretty amazing everyone you interviewed showed some sort of failure to understand the complexity of the issue they had their stances and nothing is going to change that it doesnt help that our two political parties have taken these opinions on as standards of battle it destroys the chance for fruitful conversation great video thanks for doing what you do
48,honestly as a pro choice person i would love to hear a productive conversation including everyone where we discuss ways to help new parents and babies without criminalizing or forcing most people do not want an abortion pregnancy is mostly preventable with proper sex ed and many people who are on the fence would happily keep the pregnancy if they had the financial support they need i would like the conversation to include a team of gynecologists to prevent medical misinformation from ruining the discussion the one thing that makes me upset about pro lifers is they very often use harmful misinformation
49,but you o wise omniscient one see all know all and are all get off your high horse bro were all ignorant in some way its not amazing its called being human dont even try to tell me you are unbiased
50,i agree with part of what you said but we are talking about an edited video and generally they paint brief oversimple responses to complex issues that can be talked for hours plus i didnt see that much a lack of intelectual consistency specially with their stance on abortion side by side with vacc mandate that comparison makes no sense and is a false dichotomy they involve wildly different scenarions on wild different answers and wildly different consequences it baffles me that the woman said its a fair point
51,as unbiased as anyone is going to get in day and age
52,the one thing that makes me upset about pro lifers is they very often use harmful misinformation like
53,wildly different scenarios can still be compared and the comparisons can still make sense both scenarios involve a tradeoff between bodily autonomy and some sort of greater good why shouldnt we compare positions on these two issues
54,its not really complex dont kill humans old young in a womens belly etc thats it its simple pro life truth
55,i am pro life and i never harmed anyone with misinformation ive heard of pro choicer who harmed others especially babies i am yet to decide if that makes me upset or just sad
56,i want less people so the freeway opens up lets kill these fetuses i swear everything that guy said was comedy gold
57,lmfao ye he was too funny its a shame so many people dont understand this kind of sarcasm these days
58,i am so for that bill burr shit
59,it wasnt sarcasm he was for pro choice
60,they arent exclusive bro you are exactly who adam wetton is talking about
61,that one was too funny
62,sacrifice sacrifice sacrifice
63,yes he was prochoice and in the begging he was sarcastically saying things that made he look like he was prolife
64,im astounded at your ability to ask controversial questions without starting a massive argument edit i just got to the point with the massive argument nevertheless still impressed
65,why make a distinction and attribute value onto the concept of virginity then either you dont believe in it and therefore you dont judge people with virginity as a consideration or you believe in it and you judge people with virginity as a consideration
66,people need to understand that its okay to disagree its okay to have different opinions i hate that nowadays there are only one way to solve a problem otherwise youre called many names simply because you disagree
67,the cultist dont believe in different opinions you have to follow the fairytale book or else
68,untrue
69,right is banning abortion left is saying do whatever u like its okay to disagree but conservatives banning the other side from freedom to live their life is wrong
70,the problem is perspective right is not taking away freedom from their perspective they are protecting the freedoms of the unborn
71,but people have different perspective on fetuses and unborn you can believe unborns are babies but some believe they are just cells until they are too big too abort so why are the rights shoving their ideology down other peoples throat if u dont want abortion good for you but dont force feed your propaganda do other people
72,is not only the right everyone is doing it if it was a simple problem there wouldnt be a debate about it the truth is we cannot even agree on when a fetus is considered human not even among prochoice so it is impossible to find a solution that will satisfy every side because each side is playing their own game
73,exactly so why ban abortion we should all respect each other and make the decisions for themselves this is why conservatives are fascists trying ban everyones rights at least the left is giving people the choice to do what they want
74,to protect one is to take something else from another do you not realize if we operate with your rules then both sides are trying to protect something by taking away something else and therefore is irrelevant as a justification
75,i appreciate that you are showing both of the extremes a middle ground should always be made yet in usa its two far sides in the game worst of all this dangerous mentality is spreading world wide
76,king nope can i safely guarantee its only usa that doesnt have a middle ground
77,i used to believe in the middle ground as well but one side as made far to many concessions the right and atm we are living in the lefts clown world so ive been voting on the right to get back to the middle i just hope the rights clown world wont follow
78,i dont see why a middle ground should be made on this issue either abortion is wrong in which case it should be banned or it is ok in which case no bans are necessary
79,when people say your questions are stupid you already know just by asking something that these narcissists may pick up a hint of resistance and they dont like that
80,as one born and raised in finland i was going to get aborted by fathers request but mother refused i raised to believe and understand reasonings behind finlands current abortion laws that are very strict abortion by process is really traumatizing experience not only to the woman but the doctor doing it no matter how professional they are they too are human but then there is this other factor that comes in that would make prolife very difficult to follow with every baby must be saved due chernobyl incident finland has had increased case of possible deformities baby would have some enough to consider abortion ive heard from my mother of her cousins stories of how they gave birth to babies that had no upper skull scalp and had no brain only to live a few minutes i believe abortion law is also considered mercy killing for those deformed babies because their livelihood and independence is incredibly hard to achieve and they might live with constant internal physical pain and being unable to have any say to it chances are their life expectancy is less than <number> years old at best im not talking about mild cases or aspergers or blindness im talking about really serious deformities that are medically so difficult to repair that the babies would end up either suffering after birth become stillborn or become test subject for medicine study the other reasons of course are rape economic struggle and family planning restrictions by partners request for ex i think its though really discouraging to tell my opinion on this since both sides are so extreme i understand that value of babys life its important but is it so important for us to try to make it outlive expectations with a disability that could make that childs life unbearable physically
81,of course there are always exceptions but the only thing i disagree with is when a woman has sex and then aborts then again has sex and aborts like bro
82,of course its terrible when a woman is irresponsible like that the trouble is that by trying to craft a law to stop those irresponsible women often times women who truly need an abortion are prevented from getting one and forced to carry babies to term that might kill the mother or the baby itself may be stillborn or have severe life threatening deformities
83,comment section what about the fault of the man did he do anything irresponsible asking for a friend
84,your opinion on pro life is manipulated health issues are always a concern rape is as well consent was already given in every other situation by the mother when she had sex
85,what exactly are you asking
86,how responsible or not is he right of anybody
87,the us is a country that blows out of proportion the rare cases to make abortion on demand for everyone up until <number> months or even after in california where i live even post roe v wade overturning they are trying to pass a law to make it acceptable to kill a child up to <number> days after birth we live in a country where abortion is rampant and the baby is dehumanized simply because its developing and because of the location <number> <number> children are aborted in california and i think nationwide it is <number> <number> these are not mostly people with extreme disabilities be very careful with the words you use as they will be weaponized in a already extremely proabortion society you have to realize a few things it is very easy to be prochoice when there are no survivors there are abortion survivors there is a community of <number> who have survived and those are just those who have joined the community mercy killing is extremely subjective in the case of gendercide there are entire villages in india and china that have no women in them because the mothers had ultrasounds found out the fetus was a female and aborted them in massive numbers being a woman is pretty hard in those countries so technically that could also be defined as mercy killing suffering is not measurable i have a friend with a child with extreme disabilities i also have a friend who was an adult who passed away this year with disabilities why is suicide illegal i dont know about finland law but its illegal in the us suicide is illegal because we should never advocate for it as a society we should always look to alternatives and ways to help people instead of killing them or them hurting themselves in a <number> european study <number> of children who are diagnosed before birth with down syndrome are aborted that was over <number> years agoare you advocating for more children to be aborted
88,the man should be apart of this issue and its ultimately the womans body and her choice
89,this i understand women need to take long term birth control that works for them although it might not work for everyone perfectly it still gives off good years of safety
90,vilifying the opposition is a lazy cop out to avoid conversation
91,i think this is actually the issue of responsibility and accountability
92,you think that rape victims children should be held accountable for getting pregnant after a man ejaculates in them
93,i dont even think hes referring to kids adult women dont have a right to abort their baby the only way id say it may be ok is if the woman would die from the child
94,they do have a right the unborn human is not entitled to exploit and or take the resources of the womans organs and she is not obligated to sustain the life of the unborn human its called bodily autonomy and dead people have more of that than living woman the unborn life doesnt even care about whats being done to it it doesnt feel pain cant suffer and doesnt even have a mind or consciousness to perceive anything at all its more so a life by scientific standards like micro bacteria than a philosophical one
95,shouldve thought abt it before having sex
96,maybe but they should still be able to choose
97,no but seriously some of these are kinda shocking to hear how easily they shout these onesided opinions but hey they are opinions
98,isnt it a battle of one side of opinions vs another theres no right or wrong answer
99,my mother had to get an abortion before she had me because the babys organs werent growing as it should and he was unlikely to survive after birth even if he did hell probably have to rely heavily on life support she still mentions this brother who i never met after over <number> years but she was relieved that she had the option to choose if abortion was illegal under strict circumstances it will only bring more trauma and health complications to my mom family i have a younger brother now and he is healthy and thriving living the life all parents will hope for their children
100,she at least could have given him a chance
101,for me the problem is not even the abortion but the fact that such a big number of girls are getting pregnant without having what it takes to be a mother it feels like having unprotected sex is more important than going to therapy nowadays hookup culture is the worst
102,i definitely lost some brain cells listening to these people wow great vid tho aha youre killing it
103,thanks for watching
104,the last guy was spittin tho
105,this channel is actually amazing to develop your view of the world and seeing all the different viewpoints you can have it is a breath of fresh air to see someone talking about an issue but from a firmly neutral standpoint these are the types of things that challenge your viewpoint in a healthy way and is the solution to the radicalizations of the left and right
106,i dont remember the last time i felt the need to hit that subscribe button i support your initiative and will continue to support it most of those issues are viewed as black and white were often vilified and called names for even questioning them
107,the production quality and your effort to get both sides of the story is admirable well done
108,you deserve way more subs honestly in every video ive watched so far youre doing a great job of showing both sides of the debate at hand we need way more content that actually challenges beliefs views and supposed strong arguments which can sometimes crumble under the slightest bit of scrutiny
109,<number><number> thank you there needs to be more people trying to facilitate real genuine conversation rather than just constant screaming
110,the guy that say the gift of life is creepy af red flag all over his face xd
111,youve got quality videos ive run into them a few times now and i never regret watching them all the way through
112,contraception is not hard to come by unfortunately it is for a lot of people and you can use contraception and still get pregnant
113,im so glad i came across this channel i literally cant stop binging his videos
114,great video covering both sides as expected when observing both opinions theres always those selected few that just cant stand having there views challenged
115,people who call themselves empaths are some of the most narcissistic people youll ever encounter stay away from them
116,really well done bro i am very much on the pro life side but i really appreciate that you talk to both sides and actually use questionsarguments that the other side would use in a really chill way
117,youre doing good work gen keep it up
118,i adore that sarcastic guy there would never be a dull moment
119,bruh you are so amazing and an actual wise critical thinker most people nowadays have extreme selfrightious attitude on different issues when in reality that is the most foolish thing in the world every generation thinks that they are smarter than the previous one and wiser than the one after them yet they are all the same people need to read history and talk to people on both sides and spend just one hour thinking not being in their echochambers thank you for this video i am rooting for you
120,im incredibly prolife and this video was incredibly informative and it was great to see the arguments of both sides
121,yo this was a great video love the editing and storytelling
122,saw you on ig checked out a couple of vids and i just have to say your videos are really good keep it up
123,the level of virtue signaling from that brothers and sisters dude is crazy
124,how the hell do you only have so few subscribers great work mate have my sub
125,daaaaaaaaang you nailed it there are no easy answers were all just striving to figure ourselves out keep it up gen thank you
126,i love the choice of your topics and your storytelling style dude ive watched the video on transgender woman in womens sports and even though i am an ally i did think that there needs to be definitely many rules for each sport and your video was very good especially because i love to hear different perspectives and im sure many many other people do as well and its part of us being more inclusive also watched the video on love gonna watch this too now really love the choice of your topics and interested to see what else you bring forward already subscribed and a fan whos not biased to any one side but curious to learn and empathic as well great job you are what is needed for the next gen
127,ooooooo this was such a great video your take at the end about empathy going both ways is exactly why i have a hard time discussing topics like these with the vast majority of people no one wants to have open discussions and try to understand both sides points of view
128,cool channel i often see interview type videos like this but i enjoy how you dont simply listen to their opinions but also challenge them
129,heres my response to in cases of rape if someone came into my home beat me up raped me and then left their baby with me i wouldnt kill the baby i understand that pregnancy is far more nuanced than that so im not saying every rape case is the same with that in mind not all rape cases are you walking down the street and then getting gang raped criminals like this should be castrated some cases involve two adults participating in consensual sexual activity until the man goes too far in this instance you shouldnt sleep with someone outside of marriage but if you refuse to control yourself before marriage at least only sleep with someone you have a long term committed relationship with and is someone you can completely trust and respect at that point you should probably just get married to them anyways
130,if life begins at conception so should child support
131,of course when is women is discussable but if men could get pregnanat would never be debadable
132,i really enjoy these interviews and i thoroughly agree with the final thoughts he provided
133,thank you so much all i want is an honest respectful debate on this complex issue but we never seem to get one it is always just the same hostility protest signs and hate
134,really well done video love how this video has absolutely no bias from you professional journalist could learn a thing or to from this
135,give me the pain give me the suffering as long as its theoretical and cant actually happen to me
136,you have a refreshing approach and a gentlehumorous demeanor hope to run into you on the streets one day
137,i feel i need to point out that i am firmly prochoice before i say this i dont think it was necessary to make fun of those prolife people like that still a fun video ill consider subbing after watching a few more they generally seem pretty good
138,the thing about pro life is that the is no middle ground a life is a life regardless on the circumstances whether it has down syndrome or is conjoined twins whether it was conceived out of rape or one night stand whether the child is going to survive <number> weeks out of the womb or <number> years its a life regardless so if you believe that an abortion is needed for any of these circumstances i mentioned or any other ones than you arent pro life you are pro choice because in certain situations you want the woman to have the choice of having an abortion which isnt pro life at all now when women are allowed to have those abortions is a completely separate topic pro life by pure definition is extreme and there is no middle ground i wanted to speak on the religion aspect does that guy know that since he had pre marital sex that he just committed the same level of sin as a murder because by his own definition no sin is greater than the other
139,vilifying the opposition is a lazy cop out to avoid conversation and critical thought this should be said at the beginning of every class in every school from now on well said
140,do you think adoption should be prioritized more than abortion america has not fixed our adoption foster system right sis so if we prioritize the adoption system then what do you think will happen
141,this is absolutely great content subbed
142,this is am extremely difficult subject to form a complete opinion of personally i see merit in arguments from both sides of the fence and i see faults in arguments from both sides i cant form a direct opinion on the matter i go way too back and forth with my take so its a debate that i choose to sideline myself from to allow people with more solid takes to make a determination of and yet again you did a phenomenal job exploring all aspects you could of this subject remaining respectful to both sides doing great editing work and gathering diverse takes even from different people on the same side of the conversation you rock and we really need you to blow up your content deserves to reach everyone it possibly can
143,if men could get pregnant you know what the rule is gonna be thats all im saying
144,thinking that sex is simply for reproduction at this point in history is insane sex has been about more than reproduction for awhile and most people arent only having sex in hopes of conceiving
145,i love contents like this we need more of it in this divided world thank you so so much do you have patreon
146,man youre doing some good work thanks and i hope your channel with grow
147,learned a lot great video
148,i love this common ground and sharing both side im sick of both sides yelling nonsense at each other
149,as a centralist on this matter i appreciate how these interviews were conducted and that both sides had their chance to share their opinions
150,love your concluding message
151,this video does a great job of representing the pros and cons of each side
152,theres <number> types of black people lmfao this sent me
153,heres a question for both sides are you willing to pay for it as in if youre prolife will you be willing to pay for the upbringing of an unwanted child if youre prochoice are you willing to pay for the medical procedures and any therapy for the mother
154,love what you are doing by asking these questions not only on this video but all of the videos you make someone has to ask these questions someone has to wonder is this correct bless you by who or whatever you believe in
155,this is one of those issues where i believe you shouldnt have an absolutist perspective both sides need to hear out the other side and we need to come to a balanced agreement
156,safe abortion is a contradiction in terms like safe murder
157,so beautiful to finally see well presented nonbiased presentations of issues to be honest there is nothing i see like this channel now because mostly people are trying to push their own political agenda rather than trying to stimulate discussion
158,im dead youre hilarious keep doing what youre doing
159,one thing to say whatever your stance should be something that youre up front about prolife take those steps to marriage before bringing a life into the world or contraception pro choice dont attack someone for making that choice
160,its a huge moral grey area yes i think it should be available but its not like people who get abortions are all yeah i felt a bit sick and it turns out im preggo so im on my way to pop that little bugger its hard on them too and it doesnt help when you scream god hates you
161,i love your vids sm you have a refreshing pov keep going <<number>
162,ok im sold great video subscribed
163,if empathy means no longer considering others experiences if empathy no longer means empathy i gotta agree with you personally i see this whole debate as being unnecessary people are being set against each other so we dont unite and figure these things out look what happened to you you were interviewing someone in a good way then someone came up to you and started mongering hate and anger
164,this is a great video i am prolife unless its rape or to protect the mother i know its a hard decision for some women to get an abortion but i have seen many who are proud of it and who keep getting them its really disturbing how many repeat abortions there are in the state of florida they make you answer some questions before the procedure i believe it was from <number> stats that <number> of all women listed no reason or their abortion the choices were rape socioeconomic reasons health i dont remember if there were more reasons thats an absurd amount of abortion procedure that indisputable ends a growing humanto happen for no dire reason
165,i love your videos and your bits of wisdom too low key guru
166,holy shit great video and a very good closing line
167,just starting watching your vids i cant tell if youre left or right and i fucking love it
168,r word is the exception and exceptions doesnt disprove the rule just dont have sex or use contraceptions just because you can abort a baby doesnt mean you should just like any person has the right to kill you just because they want you dead and they could doesnt mean they should btw men should have a say since it is also their child
169,these are all really good and valid questions to ask i find both sides of this debate resort to vilifying each other refusing to listen to each other and accusing one another of being basically the worst humans imaginable so beyond the pale that it isnt worth having a debate or discussion having emotions behind an opinion or subject isnt a bad thing it is when those emotions interfere with your ability to interact with those who hold opposing views im personally very prolife i believe abortion ends an innocent human life at any stage in the pregnancy but ive never thought of the vast majority of prochoicers as people who advocate knowingly for murder i simply think their logic is misguided i dont think they are bad people at least not most of them you dont have to agree with someones views but make an effort to understand them the fact this is so hard to people in todays age is stunning
170,good channel bro subscribed
171,thank you for your take i love that you dont straight up throw yourself on one side of the debate but encourage to give voice to every opinion what follows is my count on the issue trying to be reasonable it is long so most likely noone will read it but whatever disclaimerskip to the real stuff one paragraph below i wont give any overly technical take on when babies become sentient i am not qualified for that i am sure there are very intelligent arguments coming from people researching the brain tho that can be and are being made and they can push the bounds of how abortion untill some weeks scientifically proven shouldnt effect any feeling fetus i can guarantee you that what i can opinionate with certainty regardless is that my assertion when someone says life is sacred before the precursor of the brain the neural tube around mid week <number> to week <number> is formed they are ignorant about the realities of how our body workes without nervous tissue cell types that our brain is made of we cant sense anything we cant be alive without a heart too ofc so you could go of that mark too but more important for me is the question is there any chance being a <number> week old product of germination feels to the product of germination something like being us feels to us can a <number> week old whatever think reflect feel single cell organisms can react to outside influences but its a humongous stretch to assume the bacteria thinks like we do feels like we do there has to be a good reason to assume it feels something to be a <number> week old cell blob and without nervous tissue i dont see how there could be any reason counter argumentpropably many would think i miss the point and suggest every potential sentient being as sacred if a sperm cell is basically a human what i said is meaningless what does this counter argument actually mean i just hope those people follow through and either dont ejaculateever if they are male or if they are female they produce a baby every time their body gives them the chance otherwise they are murdering all the time in their logic actually even reproducing is mass murder because what of those millions of sperm cells that didnt make it but could grow to be people or is that okay because god intended those potential humans to die so one or maybe two three can live so i hope you follow through and if a male preserve every sperm cell only extracting one to artificially implant each time you want to fertilize good for you i guess common ground on this issue is beyond our capability except if you agree that personal belief shouldnt take precedence in legislation over evidence there is also no magic happening at the time of germination beyond the marvel of what is actually happening and what we can see under a microscope or with other methods and when we look at what we can actually see we see its equivalent whether we have a few cells with no means of feeling or a bigger blob of cells with no possible means of feeling either they become a human or not potential can onlly mean nothing or everything sacred soul maybe whatever but if you ask me never before we have a braincounter argument part <number>
172,didnt care for making fun of the passionate guy continuing life despite suffering is the most honorable thing a person can do someone in a wheelchair playing sports someone morbidly obese losing a ton of weight and yes a scared girl who finds out shes pregnant wrong or right and overcomes fear to arrive at the decision that it is wrong to kill the child and to bear the weight of the responsibility those people are called mothers and i fucking love mine
173,anyone answering the question when does life begin with as soon as it comes out of their womb hasnt really thought about it much it should at least be as soon as the baby is capable of living by itself which would mean after <number><number> months
174,lmao at the dude around <number><number> that is some brutal honesty and requires a lot of humility good on him
175,what i get from this video is that both the pro choice and pro life have both intellectuals who make reasonable arguments and idiots who believe in stuff they dont even know you should do more of this
176,my birth father wanted me to be aborted my mother decided to give me up for adoption i was very fortunate to get adopted from birth my halfsister spent a majority of her life in the system because she wasnt given up right away the system is mostly awful and to just say give the baby up for adoption ignores that many people who tell people to give their babies up for adoption have never and will never adopt there are so many children that are born and just shoved into the system because their parents dont want them and there arent enough people adopting and fostering there are also medical cases that are often ignored there was supposed to be a sibling in between me and my halfsister my birth mother had complications and had to abort because my birth mother did that i eventually got to meet her and my halfsister if she had decided to try and carry it is very likely i wouldnt have met any of my birth family i wouldnt have known the difference had i been aborted and that is ok with me im thankful for the life i have but i recognize that it was never my decision to be conceived or born
177,i had an abortion im pro choice but it definitely is murder i couldnt be pregnant for my own mental health it was too dangerous and i am by myself with a toddler i had to mourn the death of the baby i killed i will live with this forever but i dont regret it i was heavily affected by the hormones and i couldnt be present for my toddler suicide was a constant temptation everyone has their own challenges in life and we should practice compassion because we have no idea what those people are going through
178,bro how is this guy not famous
179,your better than a lot of news channels your unbiased and thats respectable
180,totally agree we must hear both side of the story but there are sociopath and psychopath on both side that must identified first they are those with the agenda of burning down the world for giggles
181,was hoping to learn about the two kinds of black people
182,spicy ending d the people calling themselves empaths are some of the most toxic people ive encountered tbh
183,<number><number> is disturbing dude is sussy af
184,his face <number><number> there are <number> types of black people
185,im calling it now this guy is gonna be big
186,if the father doesnt have a say on weather or not to have an abortion then the mother doesnt get to have a say for child support if she decides to keep it why can one opt out but not the other
187,dude with the glasses had his priorities right clearing the highways xd
188,bodily autonomy is already understood by many yet applied oh so differently depending on the distribution of power among groups as an american woman right now my dead body literally has more rights than my living body if i dont consent to being an organ donor now then no one for any reason can use my body after life the state cannot use my dead body even if it gives potential life but now the state can in effect force me to experience pregnancy and birth which is no easy task if you havent talked to mothers about it people should have the right to control their bodies be it mental or physical non sequitur addendum prolifers the ones ive encountered eagerly point to soup kitchens adoption churches shelters and food stamps how come in my political life ive never seen them at the policy table when it comes to paid parental leave state paid <number><number> months or universal healthcare daycare and prek the us does not ensure a cent or second of parental leave touts of family values when theres no guaranteed material sustenance for them
189,interesting video def need more room for conversation today thought the parts where u laugh at that one prolife guy kinda didnt fit the unbiased approach of the rest of the video keep it up
190,its more men than women who thinks women doesnt have the right to abortion that speaks volume about the lack of empathy to women and selfishness of men this doesnt mean abortion is always ok there needs to be a casebycase judgement of who deserves abortion however the one biologically carrying the baby and facing all the biological risks of child bearing should have a bigger say not necessarily a complete say it depends on the circumstance
191,to me it should be a choice cause choices opportunity is needed for wisdom to be learnt therefore blaming the choice instead of the education of thoses old kids isnt the good thing to do imo hope you got my point despite my mediocre english
192,when does the life begins when they breath air thats a whole new level of wtaf
193,man crazy after finishing my test in my religious education subject i came across this topic about abortion in the perspectives of prochoice or prolife
194,something ive been thinking i find it very strange how when a woman is pregnant the woman is said to be the only one who has the right to abort the child because its her body but when that child comes out the man has to support the baby and the mother regardless of his opinion on having it
195,i really hate that what all the prolife people are missing is how shit some of the laws are written these lawmakers are not doctors for the most part and its clearly obvious the exceptions for saving a mothers life are so ambiguously written like imminent death without providing descriptive definitions of what that constitutes if youve ever read laws they usually start with a list of definitions and the terminology within the law often has its own unique definition that does not exist elsewhere in the language so now there are doctors that are afraid to performabortions in cases where the mothers life may be in danger where fetus is ancephalic etc
196,i dont know how i feel about the whole law thing buti am an only child and when i was <number> or sth my mom told me she was pregnant before me and aborted it i cried like a baby that day i could have had an older brothersister i mourned for them for a while
197,you are in another level thanks from spain
198,you did a great job if pushing back on peoples opinions
199,thing is if they say that life beings at conception and it should be thought of like that in terms of abortion then they need to consider it a life in every way they cant pick and choose when its considered a life or living being like a child that has been born if its life starts at conception then other things that apply to a life would need to start there too which means child support would have to start there too and other things would have to start and be available as soon as someone becomes pregnant
200,regardless of which side youre on can we at least agree that we need better sexual education we have kids who dont know what a period is until they get one absolutely horrifying its literally the only thing thats had a major impact on unwanted pregnancies and i dont think anyone wants those apart from maybe matt kids used to get impregnated at <number> walsh
201,its so hard having that civil debate anymore it seems like my two older brothers no longer talk to me or my mother due to having different beliefs from their own social media has made people of both sides kind of stay in their own bubble
202,id be happy to answer any questions as a pro lifer i think most of these arguments coming from the pro life side or both sides really werent as fact based as they could have been
203,forgot the hardest question sacrifice the fetus to save the mothers life or sacrifice the mother to saverisk the fetuss life theres a few medical instances where the mother is left to die in states that have banned abortion doctors refuse to sacrifice their jobsfreedomjailtime in order to save lives its a hard decision for them to make
204,great that so many men are giving their opinion on what women can do with their bodies progress
205,give me the pain guy was lowkey making a lot of sense
206,great video bro what city was this
207,nice way to end the vid empathy for each other even through disagreement
208,what a great video
209,would love to see a debate between guy with the floral shirt and guy with the poloit would be comedic gold
210,<number><number> the single most based person
211,radom af but im pretty sure i know the woman who interrupted your interview at the protest lmaooo solid video again bro
212,say that last part louder for everyone in the entire world that didnt hear it
213,awesome video
214,very interesting good video
215,its like they think every single person getting pregnant is a selfish irresponsible teen mocking the whole thing ik ppl who dont use protection bc its so rare for them to get pregnant if pregnancy does happen im sure it wasnt their intention to raise a whole human at a random point in there lives
216,judging by the results of online polls that ive taken part in around the issue of abortion most people do seem to understand there is nuance and feel that abortion is appropriate in some cases but not others and i have to say i agree in many cases where going to termbeing born could have a serious negative impact on the mothers health or outcomes or the childs outcomes i think abortion is ok then you get cases like the lady who aborted <number> times because all the foetuses were male and she didnt want to give birth to a future rapist that was her reasoning yeah not ok i do think if the adoption system were better and children in care had better prospects then there would be less need for abortion in terms of the fathers say i definitely think the fathers wishes should be taken into consideration as they are affected by the mothers decision whether or not to abort however as they are not the one carrying the baby i think ultimately the mothers decision should take precedence unless of course she mother was raped in which case the father waived his right to get a say ultimately i think the most important thing is wherever possible ensuring you and any sexual partner you have are in agreement about what you think you would want to do in the event of an unplanned pregnancy
217,all right and ending like that and im subscribing
218,great vid
219,theres a topic in the subject of abortion that no one talks about in such videos female feoticide in india it was common until there were rules that came up which made checking on the gender of the baby illegal so is it okay to have female feoticide just to save that female fetus from further problems from a sexist home and sexist homes arent just a third world problems but everywhere if we are talking about exceptions like rape then why not this id love to see pro choicers answer to this because ive heard them saying things like its better to abort then have a shitty life
220,i love how this video got me questioning myself but it made me sure to where i standprolife forever
221,i loved what you said at the end
222,hands down one of the best channels
223,hot take yes its a life but the life of the mother is more important there is a reason the mothers life is always the priority during crisis situations the potential life does not supersede the already existing life and all of us to be alive something had to die the cow the chicken even the grass or plant you ate and life isnt just merely about existing quality of life also matters a great deal i would rather not have been born than have to live life as an orphan with no loving family or worse born to parents who did not want me and do not love me y would any logical person bring a life into the world they cannot support in any aspect abortion is a necessity life is not intrinsically valuable it honestly depends on the circumstances of that life
224,nothing is black and white and vilifying the opposition is a lazy cop out to avoid conversation are two great bookends to many debates but we are talking about the right to murder a person because they would be inconvenient theres nothing more black and white than that villainous scenario
225,this dude is a fking genius
226,the guy that said life is a gift well he is hell scary i wouldnt want to be his kid if he wanted me let alone if i was a product of the r word
227,as a prolife married woman also gen z here come at me i think these people were the least informed in this subject and neither side had any good arguments ive tried to study deeper into why i am pro life and yes part of it has to do with the way i grew up but the deeper i look into it the more im confident in my opinion either side needs to look at both sides and be informed do not spout things you know nothing about im pro life even in really hard cases and i think that was the hardest thing to choose being able to stay informed and perfect my beliefs and knowledge of people ask why i think that way
228,pro choice my body my rules womens right man has no saying in those kind of question nothing changes for the man but to the women changes everything
229,that sarcastic dude is so funny
230,<number><number> yes> were waiting say it
231,nice point although this subject requires thinking and asking philosophical questions no one wants to ask i cant have sympathy for prochoice people who dont think at all they are not trying to open debate they are demanding a right and an exemption
232,theres no both sides when it comes to murder the constitution guarantees life liberty and the pursuit of happiness not frivolous promiscuity followed by murder
233,just found your channel feel like i can finally breathe i find it exhausting how everyone seems to be so black and white on every issue even the issues i feel most strongly about have some degree of nuance and a lack of discourse about that really bums me out
234,nice work overall but please dont poke fun of your interviewees off camera not a good look if youre aiming to be neutral
235,im gonna need a video of just a compilation of quotes from the sarcastic guy with the beard and glasses
236,to ask if its murder is the wrong question its okay to end a life to maintain your bodily autonomy
237,mr religious at the end you will be with more than <number> billion humans in heaven for eternity you dont even understand the book dont tell others what to do
238,if biological father shouldn t have a stance why he is in obligation to pay for child support even if for instance he is pro abortion if its your body your choice why bather him for it baby is made from a father and a mother is not yours alone is not a kidney i love your videos
239,its your body its your right were you raped it should be accepted anywhere in the world to get an abortion but i do agree prevention is the cure either by the man or woman problem is one night stands when youre drunk
240,youre declared dead when brain activity officially stops not when your heart stops beating <number> weeks is when brain activity typically starts in a fetus this is generally after the point people would get an abortion depending on the country there is a cutoff when you are allowed to have an abortion
241,awesome content
242,instead of pro choice or pro life lemme raise a different argument what if we forced people to stop any activities that could result in children being born how does that make a pro life or pro choice person feel
243,they should be using facts to support their beliefs not their religion or personal life experiences this goes for both sides but i often see people who are prolife clinging onto their religion to back up their opinion
244,lmaooo at the last clip theres so many ppl like that they dont have enough brain power to think beyond where their emotions guide them
245,i didnt hear anything to make me change my mind ill be pro life forever but it was interesting to see both sides discuss what they believe in a mostly calm manner
246,bro you made fun of that guys opinion not cool dude
247,its <number> birth control is extremely effective the one i have right now is <number> effective be responsible and use protection dont end the life of someone else because you couldnt be responsible
248,i wish that there had been points made about medical complications for pregnant women as well as the dangers of delivery theres so much discourse on whether or not the child is a living person at whatever stage but the mother always is and she feels so forgotten within the pro life arguments to the point of shes just a vessel we are not just vessels and the children that we carry are not just little clumps of cells they are the eventuality of the future i am pro choice and always will be but i do think there are prevention methods that need to be better employed and spoken on to everyone not just to women but also to men we also need to look into our child protective services and foster care system more also pro life people tend to forget about that precious life as soon as it is in this world theres more to raising a child than bringing it into the world further more medical complications for a child extreme ones do exist and often times that little life is cut so short after birth is it fair to let them be born to know nothing but suffering these are questions that need to be asked i dont think that abortion should be looked at in such a flippant way as so many people seem to want to these are serious questions and aspects of the issue and i get that its scary and all but it is what it is those of us who can carry children are always in danger during the process from a million different ways it can go wrong even to the aftermath of the childs birth not to mention emotional health complications throughout and after too i could say so much more to this seriously but i dont want to get too deep into it and upset myself still i think that abortion should be available because there will be those who will find a way to end a pregnancy they dont want theyll often put themselves at risk during it too history has so many stories of the desperation of women in bad situations even in our modern world they shouldnt be discarded as meaning nothing either
249,i love how people are so caught up in their emotions while the people who hold all the money and the power only want to halt population collapse its so crazy obvious theyre scared for their money
250,i always assumed that if i went a d asked anyone who was a product of rape in althea extreme case or a single parent home if the feel like they should forfeit their life because of their mothers circumstances would they do it i grew up with someone close to me who was a rape baby and he was adopted i think i know what his choice would be also how many of us were an inconvenient surprise at the time of conception an accident if you will anyone of us that fit into the more benign of those <number> of circumstances that get aborted could have never existed my favorite its just a clump of cells all life is just a clump of cells i cant walk around and abort every clump of cells that inconveniences my life or makes me live with the consequences of my actions there would be a lot less people applying to debt collections companies for jobs if that were the case
251,love your videos
252,actually the most based political commentator yter ive seen in a while
253,i wish you hadnt mocked that dude it undermines your credibility and the credibility of people that are pro choice its not the way bro and you literally segway into villifying the opposition is bad
254,if i dont want to be a mother then i shouldnt be forced to my body shouldnt have to be forced to change by someone else i shouldnt be forced to potentially go through postpartum depression i shouldnt be forced for my teeth to potentially fall out i should be forced to potentially have my hair fall out i shouldnt be forced to do what someone else wants me to do
255,excellent love it
256,i would say the difference with the mandate is compel vs restrict there are a lot of things we cant do in the us there are comparatively few things we have to do
257,a lot of pro life thinks about foetus but once its born you are on your own
258,well all in all no matter what your opinion is women get pregnant because of men so most likely abortions are considered bc a man came inside without the womans permission so thank u to those men out there for creating all the backlash that prochoice women are facing thank u for starting the problem in the first place and u win the trophy of americas worst pull out game
259,im prochoice i think we should focus more on creating good lives for the already born children rather than making abortion about murder and then leave much more people coming into poverty and criminality abortion isnt murder because there isnt yet a consious living being the featus havent even developed pain nerves yet it is much better that most babies that are born will be in circumstances of parents that want and can be there for them every born person will have much more support and the world will be much more sustainable i still think contraceptives and sexual education should come first but humanity need abortion as an option i dont want to attack the other group and can have some understanding for having another opinion in this but i think to be prolife is actually creating a setup of more people coming into lives with much suffering which isnt really helping anybody they want well but they often create something not so well
260,great video please keep challenging peoples views
261,at <number><number> the woman said a baby is a life when they breathe air that means it is life the baby receives oxygen through the placenta
262,i quite enjoy your videos besides your bias towards that one guy in this video it was mildly disrespectful and i prefer when no bias is put into your videos but yeah i love hearing both sides without it being an argument keep doing what youre doing <<number>
263,the drunk guy was so funny
264,how does this only have 19k views oml
265,<number><number> when the heart starts beating at <number> weeks crap that kills my argument at birth
266,you laugh at that mans words but as someone who was given up and raised in the foster system never adopted he is right
267,i like how u tried to make the video as neutral as possible the people who agreed to be interviewed all had their own opinions and although some of them made little sense u tried ur best to be neutral when interviewing them
268,the context above is pretty straight forward
269,coming from a single parent household and being raised by a woman actual woman who gave birth to me and my family all agree that it is absolutely murder
270,just because you cant see the child when its insiide the womb doesnt mean that it isnt a child just because you cant see it doesnt mean it isnt there with its own unique thoughts feelings and having its own unique experience of existence and life up until it doesnt anymore science has already proved that a fetus responds to love and affection early on in the development process same with ancient cultures that have been around for thousands of years its like saying its not murder because i cant see it
271,when she said that a baby become a human when it breaths air wrong so if a baby is currently in the process of being born and we instantaneously cover their mouth and nose so they dont breath are they still not a human according to my human biology class the <number> properties of life are composed of cells able to reproduce growth and development requires energy adenosine triphosphate or atp perfoms homeostasis it even mention in the powerpoint stating while this is true for humans and many animals the act of breathing is not performed by the majority living organisms in the planet eg plants bacteria fungi
272,ur an absolute don haha the editing is top notch
273,double r once said ive noticed that everyone who is for abortion has already been born
274,human life has a right to live no matter how inconvenient
275,i know myself enough to know i cant afford it and mentally i cant care for it it would grow up in poverty and likely develop the same physical health problems ive had due to not affording medical attention and i would give it the same mental scars my parents gave me if i ever see it between the two jobs id have to work i would go to the ends of the earth to abort and that would be a mercy to anything growing inside of me
276,its like the 4th wall got broken during that speech lmao
277,maybe the last thing we need is more empaths oh man ive just watched two of your videos about controversial topics and i may just be hooked abortion is definitely a tough issue but i personally think that the prochoice argument is a euphemistic argument that trades out words like killing or murder for abortion and choice theres definitely tougher cases like with the r word that i think can be handled on a casebycase basis depending on how a pregnancy would affect the health and wellbeing of a mother but overall in probably <number> of cases im prolife
278,its hard for me to take the bodily autonomy argument seriously when we force men <number><number> to enlist in the draft
279,the guy with the glasses made this video 20x better
280,i actually dont see much in common with the vaccine comparison on one hand you have the government prohibiting a certain procedure and on the other you have the government or employer mandating it those are two very different things also the interesting thing with the prochoice side is the euphemistic language used to soften what were actually talking about most people cant even describe the various abortion procedures and the tools used and at what stage body parts start needing to be removed by pincers and vacuums im prochoice and part of being prochoice is advocating for informed choices i recently had surgery and i had everything in detail explained to me what was going to occur if youre afraid that would make people question that choice maybe thats a good thing
281,as a prolife nonreligious person im really sad to see people religious or not using such useless religious arguments to represent prolife i am prolife because i believe the most fundamental human right is the right not to be murdered
282,okay <number><number> is the only pro choice person i can tolerate because hes absolutely funny
283,he litterally said it the life that could because it is not one yet
284,this guy was raised right
285,the guy in the daisy shirt no filter i love it
286,as a mom as a person who witnessed family members who had miscarriages the prochoice reasoning makes me sad and brought tears to eyes sad
287,i think if the woman get raped or something like that its okay to make the abortion but if its her fault then no clearly no
288,the argument of its my body its my choice its my right falls apart innately because it is not your right since this decision directly encroaches on the right to live of the unborn now i am always open to think about extreme cases in which abortions may be allowed but those should be highly regulated and always tried to be steered into the direction of bearing the child and then giving it to foster care
289,abortion should only be an option in the case of rape any harm to the mothers life or other very extreme cases it should not be used as a form of birth control which a lot of people seem to be doing now
290,that pro murder guy is hilarious
291,abortion is a human right so killing is a human right who has the right to take another life do they think they are god
292,i want less people the freeway opens up that man is an early reincarnation of bill burr
293,only one side demonstrates hypocracy for my vody my choice the pro life side doesnt care about the mother in the situation she already made her choice aside from rape we know their focus is on the baby a seperate body even if its within yours you can disagree but the logic is consistent to their ideology the other side not so much
294,several problems with pro life first is their morality seems to be circumstantial at times incest grape victim danger to the mother then most times theyll allow it another problem is that they dont seem to give a fuck about the childs standard of living they just want the kid to be born and dont care about what happens after theyll cry about do the crime do the time in regards to having unprotected sex but why must the child suffer for those choices
295,meh kinda funny to me how feminism purports to be about equal rights and treatment for both sexes but a lot of feminists have no problem holding the view that mens opinions arent worth as much as womens when it comes to abortion choose one but you cant have both
296,wow that one guy with classes seems to be fun to be around
297,the right to life is a human right so the right to abortion cant be a right because youre denying a right and the human rights shouldnt contradict themselves
298,you come across as disingenuous if you sell yourself as unbiased and in the same breath laugh and mock an opinion you dont like specifically referring to your take on the brothers and sisters guy
299,i think that human life even in its weakest forms have a value and dignity i think that people need to face responsibilities related to having sex however i think there are some cases when abortion should be an option for example when the mothers life or health is in danger they are also other exeptional cases that require discussion like babies with no chance to live who would die in hours after birth some parents dont wont to handle that suffering but you know these are tragic dramatic cases others reasons like not enough money and time to raise the kid dont wanting to have children there should be more emphasis on adoption social programs adressing this issues of course that is a bit idealistic and the world is a bit more wicked selfish twisted but i still want to believe in love and humanity even if it is naive
300,so many people are speaking from a high horse as if they had some foundational natural or godly morality behind them its all manmade the intention would be or at least the proper use of it would be to allow us to live together it shouldnt be used to oppress others some of them just really dont want to think
301,im a prolife teenage girl i think that many people dont really understand how abortion works and what happens in the procedure and abortion clinics should always do a <number>d ultrasound and show a video of the process before actually doing it countless women regret their abortions the people that said abortion is ok a week before birth but not after when does life start is it when a baby can live independently people on life support cant live independently so does that mean we should pull the plug the only difference between a baby in the womb and a baby who was just born is the umbilical cord or feeding tube being disconnected and the switch from breathing through the placenta to breathing through their lungs thats why they cry when theyre born
302,though rape is something undeniably horrible i think the way we look at a child conceived through rape has to change they are still a gift because though the way they are conceived is wrong the baby itself is still an innocent human being that has nothing to do with the act of its father at the end of the day its not the rapists child its the mothers child or the child of the parents that decide to take responsibility of it and defining the baby by their method of conception is so wrong because that individual has the potential to do so much good and in no way is responsible for the heinous act committed
303,if men dont have a position why are they forced to take care of a child through child support men shouldnt be forced to take care of a child if they dont have a say in if the baby in the womb is a life it doesnt matter the sex of a person science gives strong evidence that life begins at conception
304,should have posted the interview that went south if you in a single party consent state they cant do anything to you
305,well if that woman was such an empath you should have asked her if she experiences fatigue on a daily basis and needs to curl up in her blankets for <number> hours straight unplugged from the rest of the world im sure she does shes so nice
306,life is a babys right
307,sp erm is alive m 45turbat|on should be i|| ega|
308,i dont understand why women would say that fathers dont have a say in this i mean ofc they do because theyre the childs father
309,i may disagree with the sarcastic guy but i would fucking love to hang out with him because that shit was hilarious
310,the drunk dude with the glasses is hilarious lmfao
311,facilitating genuine conversation is important the intent of your channel isnt matched by the mocking of those with passionate opinions in your videos it diminishes what youre out there doing
312,loved that story on the mandate and switching sides when it came to abortion
313,really enjoying your videos man didnt love that you kept making fun of that one prolife guy though even if it was a little bit funny
314,bro where did he find crazy white shirt lmfaooooo
315,i really wanna see an all women pro life vs pro choice debate
316,<number><number> if everyone makes mistakes shouldnt they have the chance to rectify it
317,us is so polarizing why cant you agree on a compromise in my country its illegal to have an abortion after <number> weeks of pregnancy for reason just because all it takes for women to have a complete freedom and control over their body is to watch your body and act imediately and responsibly even if you have pocs one superfluous test a month is all it takes at <number> weeks of pregnancy the embryo turns to fetus meaning all the basics are in place to start developing more complicated brain functions which create self awareness this law makes sure there is no general stigma over abortions nor its highlighted as something amazing abortion at the later date can be still done for health risks if a doctor recomends it the womans life is always priority in our health care if the babyfetus is healthy the guidelines always try to proceed with a csection to potentionally safe the baby outside of the mothers womb via an incubator no woman here feels in danger when she decides not to abort after <number> weeks they all know the health care is always on their side
318,abortion comes down to whether you value the life of fetuses or womens choice more both sides have very valid opinions and arguments abortion is killing an unborn baby it also lets people not take responsibility for their sexual actions on the other hand a fetus is unaware and will never know the difference there are a positives to abortion and it has been linked to decrease in crime neither side is evil or wrong it comes down to values and beliefs we should all respect each other and let our vote decide what the law will be
319,theres genuinely a conversation to be had about this at the end of the day its about setting a line between human and non human sperm is pretty much millions of babies waiting to be born after all but where do we draw this line like we are against killing animals for fun but no one cares if you kill fish or insects i personally think that the future and choice of someone who is about to have a baby is more important than a fetus who luckily hasnt had the chance of developing any kind of human trait but i completely understand the other side of the argument even if its commonly just an excuse to impose a conservative view but if a woman gets pregnant without her knowledge or consent its not even a question
320,why is the pro life text in red but pro choice is green in the vid
321,we have the right to life and liberty
322,<number><number> confused what does r mean
323,a question that is i belive is not heard when talked about what say men should have is if you look at what happens after the pregnacy parenthood if men should not have a say in the pregnacy how about parenthood should a man be able to opt out of parenthood
324,pro lifers and people who are against mandates are always about my body my choice just when it comes to pro life they are fighting for the bodylife of the fetus who doesnt yet have a say
325,oh man that last bit yes i agree but only up to a point im canadian and live in ottawa which was the epicenter of the convoy protests they blocked off entire residential not government city blocks theyd keep people up all night running their trucks and blaring their horns being an open minded person i wanted to know what the deal was so i went down and talked to them every single time i did though i dug down until i got to the gross bedrock of their thinking they actually wanted to forcibly remove our democratically elected leader who i also dislike btw and put their own people in power turns out they werent freedom protestors they werent worried about truckers they didnt give a damn about family values they were just traitors traitors who were too cowardly to actually say it hiding behind chants of we love you all with shit eating grins that is the limit of my open mind and want to bridge ideological gaps they have fallen too far when you want to take over the country in an undemocratic coup you are no longer just another opinion you are dangerous traitors who want to destroy everything our democracy stands for and that is simply unacceptable my party has never been in power but im not going to overthrow the election winner because im a not a giant baby having a tantrum
326,men shouldnt have a stance they cant choose to keep the child and they cant choose to have the mother abort the child yet they can be held to pay child support if the mother chooses to keep the child even if the father doesnt want to the lack of consistency is wild the child isnt viable or a human if aborted willingly but if a drunk driver crashes into a pregnant woman its double homicide the value of the fetus is based in the development soo people that are born with developmental delays are less valuable if they are only humans if they are wanted then orphans that are abandoned by their parents are less human such hypocrisy in the logic a human is a human even in its earliest stage of development we dont get to decide what to do with someone elses life their dna is unique and different to the mothers making them their own person
327,if a man has no say in whether or not what happens with the baby why should they have any responsibility no taxation without representation
328,i think both sides are right and wrong at some pointsso theres no right choices here is how individuals gauge their beliefs and rights depending on their circumstances
329,i wish you mentioned the risks for pregnant women and all of the life threatening things that can go wrong when youre pregnant what do we do about incest or children with developmental or severe mental health problems that are identified before birth if you knew at three months along that your child wouldnt live longer than one day after birth would you carry to term what about still birth or ectopic pregnancy that will kill the mother if we let bureaucracy get in the way of quick decision making thousands of women and mothers will die for no reason and so many more will end up in a broken system so sad separation of church and state is obviously a joke to this country
330,<number><number> the difference is in abortion the childs body is whats being affected there are <number> bodies in abortions only one in vaccines
331,and where do you stand on the topic
332,on <number> side its prolife what they want is clear they want life on the other side its prochoice some of you would say that what they want is also clear they want choice why would they want choice when the other option is prolife what is the remaining choice pro what why they want another choice to pick beside life for me its clear its not prolife against prochoice its prolife against prodeath
333,maybe the answer is thicker condoms lol sex is a conscious decisionthe obvious exception is nonconsented sex and you have to go in knowing that the risk is pregnancy if you dont want kids use a condom or dont have sex that simple once a pregnancy occurs then the potential of a new human is now realized and now said new human should be protected by the same laws anyone else is
334,sees that this was uploaded <number> months ago me the universe has a sense of humor
335,everyone always bring up rape ive never met anyone in real life who was born from rape or a woman who gave birth from rape its not a common thing
336,how is my body my choice hypocritical on both sides those who are prolife and against vaccine mandates make very clear their belief that these are two people were talking about a body within a body it is a key belief of the prolife movement
337,why cant people see both sides of the issue
338,they say a reason is that the girl cannot take care of the kid but what if the dad wants the kid then they say well he has no say because its her body
339,i agree that its wrong but i think the argument for less traffic is pretty compelling
340,the biological father might not be affected on his body but in his mind
341,dna is used in courts of law to prove a persons involvement its one of the highest regarded standards of physical proof according to law if a dna sample of a fetus is taken would it reflect the dna of the mother or would it be a unique dna of another person
342,i think personally no uterus no opinion
343,you shouldve used that ladys footage man just keep her blurred it was a public place and legally blurring her dace would cover you
344,the two drinking bros both with differencing opinions were hilarious in this
345,saying having sex and then aborting a baby is wrong and is irresponsible and then saying theyre forced to have it though so then why dont we force everyone to be responsible for their irresponsibilities do we do that no we dont forcing someone to take responsibility for their actions is a judgement call we have no right to make on some degree were all irresponsible and glad we have the freedom and right to decide wether or not to take responsibility for our own actions is your debt paid off is your family dynamic healthy do you have a job have you cleaned those dishes to argue babies are people though not chores my counter so the fuck are we and my point is we are people with responsibilities but that does not mean we all take accountability for our irresponsibility just like the fathers and rapists with no connection of physicality to that child to take that responsibility babies live off the female physically even after its born there is already an extreme imbalance in the duo it takes to have created that child what is imbalance unfairness what solves fairness <number><number> work since the male cannot contribute the physicality of <number><number> that is why he has no say the predisposed right of a man has a choice to physically leave the child and also not be physically connected to the child so should also be the right a woman should have as well before a baby is born that is fairness it did take two if a man cannot physically have a child neither should a woman what they share in common behind their gender is the fact that theyre both human so lets judge the fairness of humanism what you find is equality nothing is forced on the man physically so equally speaking nothing should be forced on the woman either it has nothing to do with the child it has everything to do with fairness as for the childs life and the fairness of it in nature of humanity things are killed willingly or unwillingly even animals kill their offspring after being born we are not animals no but we are closely related human nature is killing things and people with intent in history and today men will kill anyone who attacks their family an extreme example but this is speaking on the epicenter of human life we would kill anyone who would attack us what about the right of life of those killers did they really deserve to die can we really make that judgement theyre people too exactly my point its a judgement call we make under our own understanding in regards to our intent just as a mother to a childwe are speaking on the grounds of life and human rights with that said all life has a right to live you do i do people in jail do too so why arent people rioting outside those receiving death sentences why arent we giving our food to starving homelessness as the food of a baby to a womans body we dont because we decide not to it is not enforced in society to feed every homeless person let murderers live etc basic human rights are discussed on this matter so if thats going to be the case then everything else should be weighed impartially life rights and humanity but this world is not fair in human nature human nature makes decisions just or unjust precisely on the understanding of our own intent the intent to kill a murderer is no different than the intent a female decides to kill their unborn baby its a judgement call they make under their own understanding in regards to how a life will afflict their own it doesnt have to be innocent killing something that will physically afflict you is not only human nature but a right
346,the men who should have a day are the same men who take equal responsibility for having protected sex and who bear equal responsibility if a pregnancy ensues
347,as a boomer my belief is that any son that lives with his parents more than a week after highschool is fair game for a lateterm abortion
348,its not really an inconsistency to say dont kill the baby in your womb and your body your choice its only an inconsistency when you fail to represent each side adequately <number><number>
349,sex is not meant for fun ok then why do we have fun having sex
350,i love that sarcastic guy
351,i dont get why youre making fun of that guy there is no inconsistency with the belief that all humans deserve a right to life and someones inconvenience should not overturn their right to life
352,edit this a comment i made to someone regarding this topic so im posting here its not cruel at all become a parent and then you shall know financial reasons are highly valid tell me if you cant barely provide a living for yourself you can take care of a kid is providing him a bad childhood lifestyle is your answer maybe the mental capacity of that woman is not ready to raise a child do you still want that kid to live okay even if it was put out for adoption but truly there are so many children there and they highly likely dont get parents they mostly grew up in adoption centers a mentally unable unstable would end up harming the kid by any froms whether abuse or completely neglecte its existence minors this is literally a clear cut on why abortion is needed rvictims regardless of age its still valid its not calling out the kids who were born through rvictims anything bad or lower but if before its occurrence a woman says she doesnt want to its clear no now when the question arises qdoes a man have an equal to say a yes but at the same time its a bit more favored to women cause of their body if i were to ask them to do vasectomy theyll say its their choice so the same logic should be applied here as well cause growing a fetus is a big thing qare you killing a baby a no not at all see a fetus has no consciousness therefore its unable to state its rights to live its depended on the pregnant parents body for its supplies and necessities just like a parasite not degrading but giving a litreal example if the pregnant parent is not willing to cooperate what will the you cant force people to give birth if they refuse goes against right to equality but yes at the same time i as a individual do not support the idea of killing the baby if its given birth by pro choice you are not only making a choice to abort but also to keep too therefore pro choice is good thank you i didnt wanna argue with anybody i just wanted to state my opinion
353,dude please somebody somwhere give the sarcastic guy a show
354,when the selfdescribed dumbest motherfucker alive speaks more sense than <number> of the interviewees
355,that woman at <number><number> who said its not the mans choice what happens and what a woman does with her body and the baby what about the babys choice shouldnt heshe be able to choose what happens with their body especially if its life or death
356,<number><number> that is unless it is actual literal murder
357,personally i think life begins when an organism is able to react to stimuli
358,in a country where you have to pay for an abortion yourself before the 16th week should not be a problem for rapeincest or a high risk of major health problems it should be up to <number> weeks past that point it gets very difficult to still see it as a medical procedure and not simply murder
359,the hard data on unwantedunplanned children is not good at all their metrics for life expectancy lifetime earned income mental and physical health outcomes and education suffer greatly when compared to others the right to lifers bury their heads in the sand and push ideologies that they themselves never have to endure the negative outcomes from or only find out when its too late and if theyre robbed or murdered by an unwanted then they want them thrown in prison whereas if that soul had been delayed and come into the world when the mother and hopefully father are ready the metrics are far better on the subject of men getting to have a say in womens bodies i vote no hell no but that also means men shouldnt be held financially responsible for a child they did not consent to no voice no obligation lastly when is it a life every cell in my body is alive it has a metabolism and biological processes it exists it functions by the right to life argument i should be convicted of negligent homicide if i stupidly slice a piece of skin off my finger while cutting cucumbers for dinner the cells in that skin are alive are they not but with fertilization its simply cells dividing it boggles my mind that we justify culling animal populations that are over running their environment for their own good and the good of interdependent species yet we cant manage to control our own species
360,i think an interesting point is that if the father has no say in whether or not the baby is aborted => the father has no obligation to support the child and mother if a mother is the sole decider on whether or not a baby is born then what obligation does the father have to support said child if women truely want to control their bodies completely then they must be willing to take responsibility for what their bodies produce i dont think it would be fair to have it both ways then the man would just be along for the ride of what ever the woman decides in reality they are both at fault and should both take responsibility for theyre actions of course this is only really a fair concept in consentual intercourse
361,banning drugs didnt stop people from doing drugs but now people die of fentanyl ods making a law against something doesnt stop it especially with something as serious as abortion also moving countries is way cheaper than being forced to have a kid in america im against abortion but i dont think banning it will do anything because theres a seperate underlying cause that needs to be adressed
362,<number><number> the foetus is inside the womans body so there are <number> lives to consider my question would be why does the foetus have more rights than the adult woman a life that could possibly be vs a very real life like as a biologist i dont view a foetus as alive until the viability period because to be categorised a alive scientifically you have to be able to function independently thats why a virus isnt alive a foetus is no more alive than a virus and we kill them very happily but i respect a differing opinion so say it is alive its still a case of two lives being considered shouldnt the adult life take precedence considering thats the person who will have to endure child birth an altering body and all the complications that come with those the foetus doesnt even have the capacity to live until the point at which abortions arent legal anymore after than they only take place if the mother andor foetus wont survive birth
363,im a christian but im on both sides of the coin yes abortions a moral issue but it should be a private issue that the gov shouldnt be involved in
364,i have enjoyed quite a few of your videos but i do think you should consider that some issues arent just a leftright debate some will consider them instead a conversation of basic human rights and if you dont portray that in your questions you actually are taking a political stance yourself like in the way you question i would infer that you think abortion is a question with political solutions as opposed to a question of human rights i think thats why you got the response that your question is stupid ask yourself how you would have responded to slavery should be abolished or not whether women should have voting rights or not whether there should be racial segregation or not whether japanese internment camps were a good thing or not those were polarized topics historically and a lot of people want those to be debate topics today maybe even majority in some states do you think we should have that debate without considering that these include a discussion of human rights some with even much more violent demonstration than is seen at topics today even leading to war was the civil war and abolishment of slavery a bad thing in your opinion should we instead be discussing each others lived experiences on this topic and been weighing whether the slave and the plantain owners lived experiences in the conversation doing that in itself is the act of taking a political stance another issue is that sometimes i do think its important to clarify what are actual facts that can be proven statistically vs what is political conjecture in peoples lived experiences a lot of these topics have actual statistics on them that reflect what the quantitative reality of a situation is we do live in a democracy after all
365,man says he would have had <number> million friends
366,the problem isnt going to end with banning or not banning abortion it goes beyond to safe sex medical facilities proper parental care
367,if i put a <number> cents coin into a soda machine and a cocacola comes out whos that soda is it from the machine or is it mine
368,i personally am pro choice even though i would never get one myself i also support the overturning of roe v wade for one reason that decision was not the supreme courts decision to make if we wanted to make abortion legal nation wide why didnt why put it into law through congress why are we relying on the supreme court to make major decisions on the legality of abortion and gay marriage when that should be congresss job the supreme court is there to interpret the law not create laws same thing with gay marriage if we want that to continue to be legal it would be best for us to pass it through congress not rely on the supreme court that could change their mind not even their job to decide
369,cool play devils advocate but your subtle reactions with snickering leave me smh just found your stuff a couple of days ago and overall agree with your approach to discussing tough issues
370,its kinda ironic that in the land of the free as so many claim us people are not so free with their options anymore where as even in communist countries women can choose to have abortions and its not something that even need debating abortion is not the only anomaly thats seen in the us vs other more autocratic countries im not saying that the rights to abortion is evil or good thats another topic for the day rather irony and hypocrisy about rights versus the country that screams every minute about individualism and the freedom to do anything including owning guns and killing anyone you suspect or didnt like
371,the guy he made fun of maybe was the most compelling
372,its sad that they need to put context above this video
373,i dont think you really needed to mock the religious guys or the people who hadnt had sex i feel like thats more ad hominem than actual debate especially considering you didnt do the same for anybody else other than the interview we never got to see due to the woman asking for the blur but im assuming you were just mocking them for acting that way rather than their actual beliefs
374,<number><number> sex is not meant to be for fun okay buddy
375,the only important factor is the baby considering that so many babies are born in trading tramatic situations <number> seconds born and then sold into trafficking children and babies starving children dont deserve to suffer because the parents cant make good decisions this is a global issue including in the states kids are born addicted to drugs so terrible things
376,remember you also have the choice of no having an opinion
377,if the mother has the right to waive their duty to raise the baby before birth shouldnt the father also have that right if were already destroying society we should at least do it equally
378,the guy with the beer though
379,interesting how men are pro life while not even having to carry a baby
380,gen i wish you meet me on the street someday so i can answer your questions
381,why dont mothers get <number> months of benefits for their baby in their womb why are those babies not in registers
382,the hypocrisy of the dudes who have sex before marriage but wrote it off as life happens versus a woman who might do the same but ends up pregnant life happens for her too so and ill bet 1m dollars that if the baby was in his womb he would be for aborting the child men do need to be talking about it because theyre the ones who are getting women pregnant so the more men that support a womans choice the better it is for woman also if you have the means and conviction to raise a baby thats your choice good for you but why do pro lifers only care about a clump of cells life up until theyre born after theyre born and unwanted what then who is raising that baby now that baby will be without a parent and all odds are against him or her
383,tbh my country did it better way in case of mishap like r or failure of contraseptive ik can be faked it is allowed but from examination after 1dr if its less then 3month 2doc if its between <number><number> and hard no if its later then that
384,in that case killing cancerous cells should not be allowed too right
385,this question is so easy the question comes down to do you think it is ok to kill an innocent human thats it by innocent i mean not found guilty of a crime in court just based on science you cannot argue when the life process begins which scientifically begins at conception that when the process starts thats not opinion that factual science people try to use the development stage to say its ok to kill the human but logically that argument doesnt hold up because by that logic it would be ok to kill a <number> year old human because it wasnt fully developed either which doesnt fully complete until the late teens just like you cannot remove someone from life support when they are asking you not to people are for abortion due to convenience they dont want the responsibility of having a child or what having a child does to their body the argument of rape or incest does not change the fact that the human is still innocent so you cannot kill it so again the question really comes down to are you ok with killing an innocent human being are you really ok with that
386,am i the only one who notices that the gut who said theres two types of black people sounds exactly like hiccup
387,contraceptions is not expensive as a canadian female who has a job that can pay for some of my birth control pills yes that statement can be true but if i had to pay for these alone and didnt have a big money income sure buying contraception could be really pricey condoms are also pretty pricey so i agree but disagree with what this person is saying
388,the majority of the time i am not for abortion but it also depends on what the overall situation is for each case if the pregnancy is going deal serious injury to the mother or if the fetus is already dead and not taking out would lead to infected blood that would kill the mother scenarios like that other than that i hate the thought of abortion because i was a fetus once we all were and the thought that i could have easily been aborted because my parents were in a rough spot financially is extremely depressing and i want every potential child the chance to be born and experience all of what life has to offer and to destroy that chance due to immaturity or financial reasons is just cruel
389,some was extreme to say until it born to be honest i was like this probably because i didnt read in the matter abortion should be limited to the time the baby isnt human yet <number> months look good but that not clear line to draw but keep in mind <number> months baby is almost complete and can be born and live its the record winner for now so for the states allow until <number> months those really do murder
390,i like your style i think the reason the foster and adoption system is so crap is so that it can be used as an answer to why not adoption over abortion also that woman has no say in whether or not you use her image as long as you were on public property
391,i think people can have the choice but there needs to be a point in the process where you cant abort it
392,i dont really know about usa law but at my country where i grew up abortion is legal if its threaten the mothers life or the mother is a rape victim as simply as that like come on contraception isnt an expensive stuff
393,why was it overturned
394,when a woman is murdered and people come to find out she was pregnant murders get charged for two counts of murder dont they idk im just trynna put a point out there that maybe should be taken into consideration in the debate
395,men should be part of the discussion with the mother wether if they want to keep the child or not but at the end of the day if the woman really does not want to have the baby then no they have no say in forcing the person to have the child
396,a foetus starts to feel pain around <number> weeks so that might be a reasonable cutoff point also these people that are saying its murder and you shouldnt have the right are they vegetarian
397,personally i dont think i could ever have an abortion unless maybe my life was on the line it would also depend how far along the baby was fun fact at <number> weeks most fetuses can hear and detect moms voice i totally understand medical abortions and i dont think you should ever shame somebody for having to make that choice its so difficult and ive never been in that position so i cant judge but i much prefer being safe using contraception it makes me incredibly uncomfortable that some states have tried to ban planb and the like and some states even tried to restrict birth control like excuse me
398,so what i dont get about the argument that the fetus isnt alive until a certain phase is <number> things <number> if its not alive what is it then its clearly not dead its gowing developing so how can it be anything but alive <number> if they truly believe it isnt alive until a certain phase or till birth do they also believe a miscarriage isnt the death of a child would they be comfortable telling a women she didnt lose a baby but rather a clump of cells depending on when she miscarried do you only consider it alive if its wanted if thats a yes then thats some backwards logic if you ask me another thing i also question is when people say that sexual assualt babies should be aborted does this mean you inherently think someones life is worth less based on how they were created many people do exist as the result of sex assualt do you think they dont deserve to exist because of their fathers committed a crime another thing is why do we weaponize the trauma and assualt of women to make a point when less than <number> percent of abortions are performed are for these reasons if you wouldnt be ok with banning abortion for reasons outside of assualt and medical emergency then it you should be able to provide other arguments to support why you think its ok in other situations instead of always coming back to this stats show that more and more babies are aborted for having disabilities such as down syndrome does this mean you support eugenics do you view the rights of disabled people to only apply after birth if you truly care about helping women why dont we ever hear the warnings about the psychological and emotional trauma that abortions statically cause to the majority of women who get abortion if you care about women so much why do most pro choice people dislike pregnancy crisis centers and why do so many activist and politicians want to close them down
399,i think prochoice advocates need to admit a life is ending but then also detail the ways society accepts several cases when one person is allowed to take another persons life we have so many war self defense to protect others we even anne stand your ground where you can kill someones just for being threatening near you since being pregnant is dangerous and may have severe impacts on the mother and any of her existing children thrusting them into poverty tying them to an abusive partner for life there is a solid argument that abortion is protective and anyone arguing that an unborn baby is innocent must also never support another single war considering how many innocent kids die in those this is a much stronger argument than my body my choice or it is a clump of cells
400,men should get a say because it may not affect their body but it does affect their mental state
401,how did she get your number wtf thats insane
402,maybe the last thing this country needs is more empaths bro
403,we should focus more on the actual issue at hand adoption and foster care there arent nearly enough parents getting kids but there is a flood of children going into adoption and quite frankly i dont see anything being done about this why dont we fix this yes we can still have abortion as an option i would say in extreme cases but for those who just think having sex and killing fetuses is fun because they dont want the responsibility then let them have that choice to be able to put those children into good and caring families especially for those who really want children but perhaps cant have any i just really feel like the adoption portion of it needs to be fixed not just to limit what both sides have to say and to make them realize that there are other solutions out there but also to just help out these kids
404,release the footage my man i wanna see those belugas argue
405,you have to start from the proposition that the life of a human being is either valuable in itself or it is not valuable in itself if it is then abortion is wrong and if it isnt then abortion isnt wrong you do need to define what is a human being but i would say that a human being is simply a being that is a member of the category human i think all this scientific talk about viability heart beats all that stuff obscures the issue human being is a moral category as much as it is a biological one plenty of historical examples of the label human being denied to certain groups eg nazism treating jewish people as subhuman slave traders treating africans as subhuman similarly with capacity ie is the human being rational can they survive on their own etc that excludes a lot of human beings who have been born but are for whatever reason incapacitated they could be disabled or in a coma or have an injury in fact all humans are dependent in some way upon others and wouldnt survive without help in both cases we can see that the attribution of the label human being actually has very grave moral consequences i think this is where the issue lies whether the life of a human being is valuable and whether we have any right to withhold or deny the label of human being to certain groups i think abortion is an ethical problem that needs an ethical solution secular moral philosophers like mary midgley and philippa foot have i think very good nuanced treatments on the ethics of abortion
406,i dont think a baby should be considered alive until it gets out of womb and it happened due to an accidentpeople who eat meat all the time should not be one questioning womens right of abortionits more harder on her
407,subbed
408,argument <number> a baby fetus is a person they will become a person the biggest issue with prolifers is that they are valuing the possible life of a human over the actual preexisting life of a human a fetus is not yet a person they are not yet born they are not yet sentient they are not yet anything other then a parasite the women however is in fact a person she is in fact sentient and she is not actively parasitizing another organism que the smart asses in the comments to make a joke about this argument <number> but you could be killing the next einstein or mother teresa what prolifers are doing is protecting what could be baby at the expense of what already is person if you want to argue that the possibility of a person being born and adding good people to the world should be the reason to outlaw abortion then the invers argument can be made that the possibility of a baby being born a bad person is why abortion should be allowed argument <number> they chose to have sex so they should live with the consequences oh boy this is a long one driving is a very dangerous activity and many people end up in the hospital from accidents should people who were driving in a car be denied blood or organ transfusions because they did something that had a obvious possible consequence because that blood an those organs could have gone to someone who didnt do something risky and thus the person who got into the crash is affecting another life possibly causing their death because they got the blood and organs instead what about people who did all the right things and yet their partner purposely broke the condom that is a surprisingly common thing that happens and yet you expect the women to keep the child because someone else did something slimy or sometimes the contraception just simply breaks at no ones fault what about then when they are taking all the precautions and still have an accident what about those who are no longer healthy enough to carry their child or financially able to handle the pregnancy and subsequent child you are forcing them to a keep the child and possibly die have the child die or be unable to provide a healthy home environment for them or b get rid of the child into a foster care system that is riddled with abuse neglect and trauma not to mention the shear number of children waiting for a family but end up aging out of the system and are just pushed out onto the street both options are actively choosing to force a child and their parents to live a horrible life when instead they could have experienced none of this pain by just not being born argument <number> god gave you that life and you threw it away well i dont really much care about what god values or not because if god truly cared about life and he truly wanted that baby to be born then he wouldnt turn around and give thousands of other children cancer and terminal illnesses i have a joke for you what gives kids cancer more then smoking well the answer is god what a nice guy also assuming he is real which he is not argument <number> life begins at conception what are you defining life as because if you are just talking about a living organism instead of inorganic material then there is some bacteria that would like to speak to you in fact the sperm in your testes and the rbcs flushed out during every period would also like to talk to you if you are talking about complex organisms then there are some plants that would like to talk to you when you just chop them up or rip them out of the ground if you are talking about sentients then well a dog is sentient but a fetus when it is aborted is not sentient so again what do you mean when you say life argument <number> sex is not meant to be fun then why have we evolved tissue that specifically evokes a pleasurable sensation because the action is meant to be used for either fun or reproduction argument <number> it is murder is it now well lets see here we kill people and allow people to be killed all the time even though their heart is beating and they are still technically alive people in comas people who are mentally dead people who are denied housing and free health care people who are denied entry into the country from their war stricken home murderers who are released from prisons because there is no more space murderers who are not convicted based on technicalities people with mental illnesses are allowed to keep their children people who are abusive are allowed to keep their fosters priests who rape children causing them to kill themselves are just moved to another church shall i continue because i do have many more examples argument <number> men shouldnt have a say screw off with your fake equalist rights nonsense women who think men should not get to speak on these topics are the same ones who slap men freely and then cry if the guy slaps them back this whole men shouldnt have an opinion is exactly like saying muslims should not be allowed to say anything about christians or the religion that being said no men should not have a say when it comes to the individual womens right to have an abortion as in if a couple get pregnant the guy should be allowed to say if he does or does not want the baby but he should not have control over if the baby is or is not aborted on that same vein if the women wants the child and the man does not he should not be forced to pay child support if they were to split up though this should be written up in a contract to protect all parties argument <number> do you support mandatory vaccines mmm no and yes no i do not support mandatory vaccines that have not been tested and studied for at least a year or so that being said well know childhood vaccines that have been successful for years in maintaining the health of children yes those should be mandatory this is because there is a difference between the possible life and health of an unfeeling fetus and the actual living breathing conscious child that can feel pain and illness but ultimately this question has nothing to do with abortion laws a vaccine is vastly different then one single fetus clump of cells a vaccine potentially affects anywhere between <number> person to <number> million people while an abortion truly only affects two people the women and the fetus you can argue the father is involved but they should not be affected because it is not a person and if you are already attached to this thing or the idea of this thing you have a problem argument <number> should foster be prioritized over abortion this is the same issue as whether or not immigrants should be allowed into a country or not i know i know but bare with me how does it make sense for a country to take on an additional burden of people and provide housing food and health care to these people while the people who are already in the country dont have access to these things its like to make a train of analogies rescuing people from the ocean and bringing them onto a boat then ones the boat is filled you just dump the people already on so that you can go to the next group of people and bring them onto the boat and so on and so on with abortion and the foster system why are we arguing about whether we should control and force people to have kids while there are thousands of children in the foster system who will never have a family and end up aging out of the system it makes no sense that being said even if the foster system was fixed up and whipped into shape abortion still should not be outlawed though the case against abortion would be stronger if that happened
409,we are all clumps of cells
410,good video
411,if abortion is gunna be legal men need to have the right to force the woman they got pregnant into having an abortion
412,this american freedom is too expensively free goodness
413,<number> corinthians <number><number><number> moreover brethren i declare unto you the gospel which i preached unto you which also ye have received and wherein ye stand <number> by which also ye are saved if ye keep in memory what i preached unto you unless ye have believed in vain <number> for i delivered unto you first of all that which i also received how that christ died for our sins according to the scriptures <number> and that he was buried and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures
414,its so sample just like that guy said have safe sex we are in <number> people should be more responsible
415,i am pro choice but saying life starts when they come out of the womb is theoretically and morally wrong a full term baby in the womb and a baby just born have both the same level of development and capacities they feel hear and think so if you terminate a full term baby it is infanticide putting the needs of the mother before the baby is morally wrong and selfish then you would be making the statement that it would be legitimate for people like casey anthony to murder their children because they simply do not wish to be mothers anymore for me <number> weeks is the ultimate limit for a pregnancy termination as we know that by that time the baby is fully formed can react to noise can see and is viable if born although very premature
416,whether a baby is in a body its still a life its murder its evil and u had a choice to not get involved in the activity to create that life theres no excuse dont involve in the activity or tie ur tubes
417,land of the free except womens own bodies
418,id love to see the argument about vaccine mandates knowing what they admit about them
419,i feel i am right leaning on this specific topic and many others like the trans women in sports but i will say i am left leaning in things such as vaccines and trans people as a whole i have been villafied by many in my friend group because i regularly consume right wingmedia such as ben shipero andrew tate and steven crowder but what i feel many leftists or these empaths dont see is that as much as i am agreeing with anti abortion with exceptions and anti trans in sports i will physically cringe when they talk about not wearing masks duing the pandemic and not taking vacines
420,next time you should ask whether the father should have the right to choose to pay or not for child support
421,well hey they cant legally take organs from a dead body unless the family or the person who died signed a form so that literally means in some states pregnant people now have less rights than corpses you cant take a kidney from someone else to save your own life pregnancy has a long list of complications as well so yes it is a life threatening situation sometimes i also want to stress life is not a gift for everyone sooo entitled to hear a healthy able bodied person say that lie carrying to term a severely disabled fetus giving birth to it and having it not die right away and live temporarily in severe pain is traumatic but guess what how do they die they cant be euthanized when they are out of your body nooo doctors will tell you to just let it dehydrate to death is that really more humane than abortion is it
422,not using as birth control not tax payed for as i personally do not wish to pay for someone elses abortion as i personally am against most unless womens life is actually in danger obviously as i just said only in case of womens life actually endanger not she just doesnt want it rape well depends it is very rare thing and even then if women is waiting around before deciding then no i mean if you raped then maybe go straight away to get checked
423,i bet you i bet you interviewing the pro life people was so much more chill and friendly compared to the abortion people i wonder why anyway if you want to abort the baby just dont have sex no one forced you many things you can do <number> not have sex <number> dont talk to men to risk having sex <number> dont go close to men <number> have nothing to do with men <number> dont look at men <number> dont think about men <number> go to gay bars
424,dont forget me when you get famous
425,all i am going to say is if men were able to have babies abortion would be allowed everywhere they would never fight against it but because it isnt them having to push out a baby of course they want to make sure women suffer even if it means the baby will grow up unloved in poverty or abandoned or that the mother will die in child birth but sure let men control abortion
426,i remember debating the complexity of abortion a lot and to this day i feel there are extremes that would make abortion ok health reasons birthing a child could take your life rape it was forced mental trauma or hey take care of it in the first few weeks when most people would consider it not to late i know there are prolife out there that would not even agree with my opinion on some of this and really it seems hard to know where to draw the line to when its not ok or when it is based on everyones opinion
427,they say mans body is not effected but man pays child support and are parent as well so i think both parent should have equal rights i am against abortion though but if its legal father should have equal say
428,women should have a right for abortion simply because men can have <number> night stand and walk away it is not a question of morality at this point it is a question of well being and well being of the potential child also i am talking about abortion within first <number> weeks
429,i think the side who is not killing babies is the right side
430,in the bible there was an idol called moloch when a couple sacrificed their firstborn they believed that moloch would ensure financial prosperity for the family and future children its the same reason most of the abortions are performed today ecclesiastes <number><number> what has been will be again what has been done will be done again there is nothing new under the sun
431,i would date sarcasticaf so funny
432,abortion has been around long before roe these abortions were not done with a medical professional and risked womens lives the overturning of roe will hurt many women making it difficult to access abortion what scares me is the amount of people who will then hurt themselves due to the fact they do not have safe access to abortion i think the main thing that people miss when arguing about prolife vs pro choice is this factor i think it really should be up to the pregnant person and their doctors the laws of restriction on women will only hurt them we see this already when dying mothers have to request their governor to have an abortion this whole thing is just super messed up
433,its really simple was the zygote viable until you intervened if it was you murdered someone period it was otherwise going to be born and grow into an adult there is no wiggle room here you stopped the natural formation which would have occured without your intervention now on account to why youre getting an abortion if you were assaulted and you dont want to birth it thats fine but you still ended the life of what would have been an innocent child that was part you also they could have came out and changed your life making you heal from the process or changed the world for the better everyone has the right to decide but to say the man should have no say is calous at best and spiteful on average he also took part in procreation and the child literally wouldnt even exist without his contribution he shouldnt be able to force anything on you but his opinion should be considered men feel pain too and do feel the loss of their children even unborn ones im sure there is a biological or emotional connection for the mother during pregnancybeyond a father would fight to his last breath to defend his woman and children especially if she was pregnant a real father would at least same for a mother i digress at the end of the day we all have the right to a choice but to blame the victim isnt the best solution they are also a victim like you were it boils down to this and you have to accept the weight of your choices
434,unpopular opinion fact abortion is not a human right nor is it a womans right if it were a human right it would occur naturally if it were a womans right she wouldnt need someone to do it for her miscarriage is not abortion before that person chimes in abortion is a medical procedure performed by medical professionals it is a service just like any other service except that it can and should be rough on mental health just as it would be for a cop to find a corpse of a baby or a medical examiner cutting open a baby with that being said if anyone should be given the right or choice in the matter of aborting a unborn child it should be the medical professional considering they are the ones who actually have to kill and extract the dead body for the record i am not prolife i believe that the cut off for elective abortion should be the first trimester if you cant figure out if you want to keep a baby within <number> months of it growing inside you than that is your problem otherwise abortion should only be allowed past the first trimester if there is no chance of baby survival the mothers life mortality not social or professional is at risk or the baby has a high chance of being born mentally or physically disabled in the case of rape including incest the rape kit comes with plan b it goes back to responsibility we understand rape is a difficult thing to go through we understand your a mental wreck after but you also know that time is ticking and you were victimized people have to do things that are difficult all the time get the fuck over yourself and do what you know needs to be done note obviously not talking about women chained up in some psychos basement for god knows how long women have been very careless since abortions became medically available as an elective and they really need to learn to be responsible in their lives and hold themselves accountable for the choices they make abortion is just another way for women to have their cake and eat it too also since rvw was reversed and some states may not permit them any longer i believe that in any place where abortion is still permitted men should also be able to financially abort the baby if she chooses to keep the child and he does not want it reason being he has absolutely no say in whether or not she keeps or aborts the baby and she is able to abort it against his wishes if he did want to keep it ps abortion clinics and child support offices really need to stop assuming men are all psychopaths who force women to abort babies or stop child support one of the first questions always asked is to women in these facilities is are you being forced thats bullshit and extremely sexist since men have no say in either and women <number><number> get custody in a split even if they arent capable of supporting that child themselves women with babies in which the father died some how cant get child support and have to figure it out yet if a woman cheats or decides to leave the father then its automatically fuck the dads ability to even support himself due to outdated payment percentages that entire system needs reforming fight me
435,heres the thingim fpr abortion if medically nessecary like i can die during or pass down my chronic disabillities and illnessesi barely can make it living on ssdi imagine hurting myself during and bringing in suffering to my childno thank youthere are accidentsim on bc and my bff was a depo baby like i said i think if u have medical issues it should be ok even with still borns
436,<number><number> wow that guy does not understand that not everyone wants kids and that people are not obligated to have them i guarantee if someone found a way to get him pregnant without consent he would be singing a different tune god is not real
437,first you would have to determine when life starts and what rights that an unspoken human has think of animals they have rights yet they dont speak but we speak for them i take my position that once conception begins life has already builtin rights and the female body is a living host her body is no longer her own but a human factor that is producing a new life which is being develop by her hormones and not by her choice in addition to being sustained by natural law in rare conditions there should be an exception in the cases of having major defective developments should be terminated and rape crimes the female is given two choices on rape crimes one to keep the child as her own or the state takes the human and compensates the mother for her <number>month terms that she endured during her pregnancy if the state decides on not to terminate and not all cases would qualify due to term
438,great video i wish u found a prolifer thats a woman
439,if you see how the procedure is being done blood and tissues being sucked continuously you will think twice accidents do happened just be responsible enough and use contraceptives
440,im very much an atheist whos currently getting a degree in biology but im also a believer of abstinence and prolife biology speaking life is being made of cells so conception is thehniclly alive there are also situations that should be exseptions such as rape or medical emergencies dad should have a say on it to because it takes two to make a baby and many dads would choose to raise a kid alone over them being aborted life is a one in a trillion chance in the universe dont throw it away for convenience or your mistakes
441,i love this i bet the guys preaching pro life probably went home and ate a fat juicy steak and didnt give two shits about the life that was lost i am not a vegan but i just cant comprehend this insistence that human life is just so damn precious that it is a miracle we are on our way to <number> billion humans doesnt sound all that miraculous to me we only live once and no woman should be forced to carry a child for <number> months regardless of what brought her in that situation i think both sides can agree that people should be responsible and take all necessary measures to avoid a unwanted pregnancy
442,a fixed time period should be allowed for abortion like <number><number> weeks in case of rape you cant enforce a lady to give birth to kid which actually happened in us so a period should be specified for abortion
443,its interesting to see how so many like myself are gravitating towards pro life not only because of the demonstrable lack of cogent arguments coming from the pro choice advocates but the consistent absence of intellect empathy and tolerance they exhibit hysterical screaming shout downs and abuse towards anyone holding a different view have become their hallmark sad
444,you can just use anti conception hell nah i aint using <number> condoms a day
445,oh im gonna need a couple hours to write my opion on this shit you got a couple weeks to let me rage lmao
446,good video and i like what you do but better when youre the interviewer in the middle and not making commentary on the opinion of an interviewee ex pro life <number><number>
447,from the best that i can tell conveniency should not dictate morality killing a baby is not a right outside the womb or inside the womb is it inconvenient to the said careless mother yeah of course it is but thats not what dictates the whether another life gets to live
448,i think we can all agree that abortion is entirely selfish and disregarding of another living creature but the debate really comes with now much more important is your future without a child than a future is with one
449,the religious would take our free will if they could
450,i think drunk men should not be asked on any topic
451,im pro choice i think babies are developing personhood i associate personhood with being cognizant rather than being human and alive personhood is completely irrelevant to why im prochoice after a cutoff lets say viability people shouls be able have an abortion with the consent of a doctor not murder it is killing a human life but thats not the same as murder similarly killing someone in self defese is nof murder i think its morally neutral to get an abortion i think its morally wrong to force someone to continue a pregnancy against their will ie ban abortion men should have an unequal say like you can express your opinion but its up to the person carrying the baby if they want get abortion or want to carry to term i am pro vaccination it think its fine for companies and colleges to enforce vaccine madates for public health you could technically not get vaccinated if you want you just cant enroll in my school because youre infringing on the vaccines also dont cause material harm in the sams way pregnancy can and for those that are exempt for health reasons vaccine madates help them the most adoption should be prioritized but its not a solution for abortion if someone doesnt want to experience the side affects of pregnancy and child birth then adoption is not a solution
452,<number><number> if it is an actual baby then do we start counting its age from its conception or the moment it comes out of the womb do we celebrate its birthday or conception day does a woman get to claim its benefits since she is carrying an american citizen is a man booked for double homicide if he kills a <number> week pregnant woman if we are considering a fetus as a human being then we should go all the way in
453,i do see the point of both i wouldnt call abortion a murder that seems a bit harsh its not a fully formed human yet but i can definitely see how a woman would mourn the baby she loses but at the same time contraception doesnt work <number> of the time rapes happen pregnancies that are dangerous to women happen plus everybody on prolife side is talking about those fetuses like you pop one out and youre done but you need mental capacity finances and a ton to raise that kid or to give it up for adoption a kid you were growing inside of you for <number> months now you have to give up and adoptionfoster system is far from perfect i wish there was better sex education fewer rape victims so that there would be fewer abortions but you cannot make me carry a child if i dont want to for some of the reasons i mentioned above mental financial health reasons plus research shows that women who are denied legal abortion just go and do it illegally and die in a lot of these cases or get health problems is that a better alternative
454,is it murder only opinion but i think yes i also know it with everything i am it should be no ones business what one decides to do with available technology what we have is freedom what people are asking for is control let words be words and not an ego tripwire once the women get their freedom we free the men too
455,im in the middle when its comes to abortion because both sides can be extreme for ex pro life are against abortion no matter the situation even if its rape or incest even if the baby has life threatening deformities where the baby will have to stay in the hospital for the rest of its small lifetime internally suffering in pain and eventually pass away seems selfish to keep alive then you have pro choice that call the baby just a life or clumped cells or fetus that its not a baby and then continue to say getting an abortion is not murder just call it what it is murder and they also say you should get an abortion no matter how many months deep your into the pregnancy they completely ignore the baby is a human life the most vulnerable because heshe does not have a voice the baby did not ask to be brought into this world you created the baby by consenting to have sex with someone regardless of the consequences of your actions take responsibility and accountability for it
456,<number><number> this guy is based
457,is abortion murder the subject of abortion is perhaps one of the most highly charged issues of our day finding an honest answer to the question is abortion murder takes courage for those who have performed abortions or have had abortions themselves the bible is clear about the fact that murder is wrong exodus <number><number> however in some cases the bible does not forbid killing soldiers representing their country were expected to kill soldiers on the opposing side joshua that is not murder animals were killed for food and for sacrifice exodus <number><number> genesis <number><number><number> that is not murder either murder is defined as the unlawful premeditated killing of one human being by another murder is unlawful killingthat is killing that is done by the judgment of one human being against another for personal rather than national reasons the bible condemns murder repeatedly as a characteristic of a wicked society deuteronomy <number><number> isaiah <number><number> hosea <number><number> matthew <number><number> determining whether or not abortion is murder involves two considerations first whether or not a fetus in utero is actually a human being and second if a fetus is a child whether or not abortion can be rightly called murder since it is legal in most countries if murder is unlawful killing it would follow that a lawful killing would not be murder one reason murder is outlawed in many places is that it is unethical for one person to unilaterally decide the fate of another under the old testament law a murderer was not put to death unless there were multiple witnesses no person shall be put to death on the testimony of one witness numbers <number><number> in war soldiers do not decide to kill for their own purposes rather they kill in the national interestif they fight for an honorable nation the national interest will be to protect innocent civilians from some threat abortion is different abortion is killing based on a mothers unilateral judgment and choice such unprovoked killing of the defenseless is unethical and should define abortion as murder in any societyunless the fetus is not human if the fetus is just a mass of impersonal tissue or something less than human ending its life would not face the same ethical challenge and would not be considered murder so is a fetus a human or is it something else biologically speaking human life begins at conception when the mothers egg and the fathers sperm come together they combine and create a new string of dna that is personalized and totally unique dna is coded information the blueprint for the new humans growth and development no more genetic material needs to be added the zygote in the womb is as human as the mother in whose womb it dwells the difference between a fetus and any one of us is one of age location and level of dependence when a mother aborts the process of fetal development she is destroying a unique life the bible clearly points to conception as the beginning of human life samson said i have been a nazirite to god from my mothers womb judges he refers to his unborn self as having already been what god planned him to bea nazirite david says you formed my inward parts you knitted me together in my mothers womb psalm <number><number> again we see david referring to himself as a person in the womb then he says your eyes saw my unformed substance in your book were written every one of them the days that were formed for me when as yet there was none of them psalm <number><number> david is saying that god had all of his days planned out for him while he was still in the womb again this evidence points to personhood beginning at conception rather than at the moment of birth we see god had a similar plan for the life of the preborn jeremiah before i formed you in the womb i knew you before you were born i set you apart i appointed you as a prophet to the nations jeremiah <number><number> the bible considers a fetus to be an unborn child a planned human being that god is forming from the moment of conception this being the case it doesnt really matter what human jurisprudence says or how socially or politically acceptable abortion is gods law takes precedence a mother who decides to abort her child is unilaterally making a decision to end another persons lifeand that is and always has been the definition of murder
458,pro aborts always say its not for me but i will not stand in the way of other women who need this procedure
459,my stance on this subject is more so prolife lots of religious influence however there are a few exemptions i do have firstly instances of rape i think that if the woman consented to having sex then the child is par for the course however if the woman was raped this no longer applies secondly if the woman is underage pretty cut and dry there and third if the mother andor child will die due to the result of birthing also pretty cut and dry if none of these apply to the situation of the woman then abortion should not be an option
460,i grew up very christian that means nothing but that you were never a christian or youre an apostate
461,growing up rich and then being one of the poorest poor people are not the end of the world
462,i have a question if men cant have an opinion on if a baby lives or not then what about trans men
463,as a man a man maybe deserves a conversation but not a say with that said thats my only opinion on abortion lol
464,when does life start when does a baby in the womb feel the pains of being ripped apart during abortion i understand abortion because of rape medical issues and even incest but i can not understand the termination of a healthy baby
465,how dare someone stand in the way of a blood sacrifice to baal
466,can you have an abortion an hour before delivery
467,the people who were saying my body my choice about vaccinations were <number> being satirical and pointing out the hypocrisy of the left and <number> were actually talking about their body one human life one persons dna
468,there arent two sides to everything the second your action directly affects another negatively your opinion is moot slavery is great for the slave owner fascism is awesome for the dictatorautocracynot so much for the ones who are subject to their wills oh and the overwhelming majority of all abortions are performed before outside the womb viability so i dont care to hear some drivel about life begins at conception i gather my medical information from the peerreviewed concensus of medical experts not people with strong opinions one way or the other
469,but who said contraception is expensive in third world countries
470,im anti abortion pro life but i am also pro choice but when i think of pro choice i think of letting yourself get over weight dying hair tattoos not shaving shaving piercings vaccine medicine where it actually impacts on your body while being anti abortion is destroying a fetus aka human child which is inside the womb only attached to the mom by a tube also did you know that any age human is a clump of cells just when you are an adult you are a larger clump of cells this is just how i see the words and other people will either agree or disagree
471,<number><number> not to be mean or anything but if men shouldnt have a right of say on abortion why should queer people have it not like theyre gonna be pregnant any time soon
472,based
473,on the why do men have a say it takes two to tango its his sperm involved not our fault nature said the female would be the one forming the human
474,its simply immoral after <number> weeks when the heart starts beating
475,of course a man should not have the right to tell a woman if she should have an abortion and telling a woman not to have one is not much better but in all these cases the man should not be considered the father if he disagrees in fact he doesnt a man cant just run away and avoid consequences as the woman could
476,my opinion is that abortion is morally wrong but im still prochoice i think people should be able to make choices even if i think the choices are wrong
477,followed
478,i always thought some more apt comparison to abortions would be live organ donations blood bone marrow not the use of contraceptives or child support those are procedures with risks associated minimal as they are and they are entirely voluntary even if its your kid or relative should the state decide if you can be forced to donate a kidney to your son should a woman get the option on deciding whether or not her husband gets a vasectomy regardless of his opinion and the fact that it is his body if you dont think that people should be forced into those medical procedures i dont think its right to abolish abortions its never about the potential life in those arguments when it comes down to it even though it gets pushed to the front a lot for most people its about the fact that they think the person having the abortion is a at fault for their state and therefore due some punishment that is not to say that there should not be limits or that it is the right thing to do but the vaccination case and covid rules are a great example that when people are personally affected they are suddenly not as okay with having restrictions even if innocents might suffer
479,i have mixed opinions on abortions i wouldnt get a abortion but thats just me personally some people who get abortions who chose to have sex its there problem one thing i hate is when people joke about it and say a whole bunch of dumb shit but i do support the ones who were raped i was raped but i didnt loose my virginity so i can kind of relate and i feel bad for them i mean who wouldnt hopefully but those are the only ones i support
480,the definition of kill to end life the definition of life homeostasis organization metabolism growth adaptation response to stimuli reproduction each individual cell of that fetus meets these requirements the fetus as a whole meets these requirements its alive
481,<number><number> i died
482,lord have mercy on these people for they do not know what they doing repent from ur sinsimagine killing innocent lives
483,men should be allowed to talk about abortion people without children should be allowed to talk about child abuse people who didnt own slaves spoke out against slavery morality isnt dictated by what directly affects you
484,abortion is immoral because it causes harm but it also prevents harm being pragmatic about the world mistakes happen and we cant prevent people from getting pregnant out of wedlock knocking up a mistress having sex as a young teen etc historically the alternative to safe abortions is unsafe abortions and murder of a delivered baby roe vs wade was a compromise and moderate position which made it both legal and illegal to have an abortion depending on the gestational age in order for women to have autonomy of their own bodies and be free to live without fear of getting pregnant abortions are necessary society doesnt treat fetuses as protected citizens anyways we dont give them social security numbers we dont let pregnant women claim fetuses as dependents on their taxes we dont require men to pay child support on fetuses we dont let women who are pregnant travel in the carpool lane etc
485,so she said a day before is ok to abort but after the kid gets past the clit its a nono so the clit blesses cells into humanhood
486,<number><number> im mean maybe she is affecting the feelings of a pro lifer but no real life harm happens to them
487,i think that the fact that some people forget with my body my choice is that the fetus a human being has their own body yeah its inside your body but it is not your body you are deciding about your sondaughters body therefore you are contradicting yourself if the counterargument to mine is that it is still inside of the mother so she gets to decide it is still an act of choosing to end a life and the doctorsomeone who promises to preserve life and health has to kill someone why is it any different than normal murders and worst of all the baby isnt even given the opportunity to live a life others get to decide it heshe cant even fight back and will never be able to and that is a fact that abortion takes advantage from it is just sad looking at how many innocent lifes are lost every year because of abortion
488,what i find interesting is that this is a societal issue in some tribes they sacrifice babies and dont find anything wrong with it we look at that and say thats terrible and the culprit should die but in some tribes killing your baby while youre pregnant is a death sentence or you get shunned thats all to say that we know that its a life but still choose to kill it i bet if you made the moms look at thier baby through a monitor while it happened and showed them the end result some or most would change thier minds i actually think that should be a law
489,its the money involved in modern day protests scammers are very good at manipulating irresponsible people beyond reasoning
490,i believe the father should have no say in the pregnancy if she doesnt want it you cant force her but the father should have a say if they want to be involved with the child if a woman wants a child and knows the father doesnt want it she shouldnt be able to force him to be a parent and the whole having sx has consequences just is the antiabortion argument thrown at men
491,the heart starts beating at <number> weeks i would say after birth huh
492,at the protest you found out that pro choice advocate cant keep a straight argument because they know its wrong that should tell you all what you need to know
493,if you dont get vaccinated you affect more people ask them how how theythem should keep up with the science
494,how are they worried about a clump of cells but not the black people who are purged by police or the massive homeless population they need to worry about why they choose guns over kids safety in schools
495,how different would the conversation on abortion be if both men and women could become impregnated
496,i love how pro aborts now call the baby a parasite they are sick
497,answer this if one murders someone they go to jail and then to court right then why is it ok to have abortion is not committing murder
498,i heard someone ask a good question if its a womans right to have an abortion then should men have the right to not pay child support
499,im so happy that still <number> of children have both parents
500,everyone ive met who is pro choice is anti gun i dont understand how you can be anti self protection and worry about gun control when <number> of the time you have an abortion someone dies
501,the woman growing the baby should have more autonomy over her own body and what grows inside of it than the baby growing inside her no ifs s or buts
502,<number><number> it was not god who chose to put the seed in the womb it was the man
503,in the case of rape does it not make more sense to kill the rapist instead of the baby why should i have to die for the crime of my father
504,hell to many men in this video
505,if someone murders a pregnant woman that person more often than not will be charged with two counts of murder so then why not the woman who willingly kills their child
506,pro life crowd was very well articulated and insightful pro choice crowd was rude and obnoxious and extremely uneducated glad you could make this observation so obvious for us
507,adopt not abort a real choice would be adopt or keep the baby
508,i want to marry the funny hawaiin shirt guy
509,sentientism is the only valid opinion on this topic
510,it should be a womens right to have an abortion however abortion and i cant stress this enough should not be used as a form of contraceptive there are plenty of alternatives that are very affordable additionally it should not be something that comes out of the pocket of taxpayers if you make the decision to have sex youre always risking the chance that youll get pregnant my biggest issue with the subject is when people try to dehumanize the fetus like it or not that is a human life that is growing in your womb many of the women i know who have had an abortion say they feel guilty that guilt is the ultimate price you pay for terminating a human life
511,men should not have a say in this
512,why did you laugh and make fun of the one prolife lad but respected the others did his passionate opinion not deserve to be taken seriously and respected
513,so much for unbiased journalism just making fun of the most zealous prolifer
514,did you have to make fun of the dude tho he didnt say anything bad and if anything was just positive i feel like you vilified him in a way then ranted about it seemed like a bit of hypocrisy love your videos usually tho
515,<number><number> you are right its not your choice it is not our choice it is the choice 9f the woman carrying the fetus
516,personally im prolife and a catholic so lets get that out of the way but i think abortion should still be allowed like the term better be safe than sorry implies thought you might not need it others might its the land of the free that is their choice that is their freedom do i disagree with it yes will i in any form help support the aftermath of this woman having this child no so my opinion should not matter to her state should be separate from church everyone remember that
517,please its all about religion i like one guy said well my parents are christians but it doesnt affect my decision clearly it did
518,do we really want these people raising kids
519,the better question is why is there no law for the men to part take in the responsibility of this potential childs life thats my main thing youre making women have babies against their wishes and put this unrealistic expectation on them to raise the child despite their reasoning for not wanting the child and yet have not created an equal and unfair system that hold the men accountable wtf
520,women say that father shouldnt have a say but i can bet my left testicle that those women would feel entitled on mans wallet when it comes to child support
521,<number><number> that argument could be used for being against birth control as well arent you angry that all the children prevented by birth control dont exist as well
522,the earliest a baby has survived outside the womb is at <number> weeks
523,im on the fence here its not murder come on guys but its also in a morally grey area definitely abortion is something we should definitely have but their are way to many being performed
524,saying my body my choice with the vaccine but still being pro life is not a contradiction not when you believe that the fetus is a separate life in both instances you are saying that someone with more power ie the government or the mother should not force decisions on you especially potentially life altering decisions
525,what kind of mother would murder their baby
526,the problem is rich people will always be able to get an abortion if they want one no matter what
527,they should have rights over there body such as when to have sex when not to if they want to do it safly or not but when it brings in another humans life then they can not kill them
528,there are young people who actually think in america oh boy america has hope
529,i appreciate the effort to show that there is inconsistency on both sides but the examples you found werent contradictions for being prolife the antivid vaccine being my body my choice is entirely in line with the prolife position since vaccines can only protect the vaccinated if you get vaccinated then youre safe if you dont then youre the only one whos making the choice to put your health at risk no one elses health unless the vaccine doesnt work thats been the most deluded argument for mass vaccination that everyone needs to be vaccinated or no one is immune that isnt how immunization works if it were then the vaccines you get when traveling to africa would be pointless because most people over there arent vaccinated for all the diseases they face
530,ill drop some facts on you an abortion isnt just about getting rid of a baby but getting rid of anything in the uterus like cancerous cells or any other growths so even if you keep your legs closed you may still need an abortion if your body makes a clump of cells for any reason
531,the prochoice title is used too liberally imo most people who claim to be prochoice lack the knowledge of alternative options as well as the cons that comes with going through abortion mentally and physically i enjoy pointing out the flaws of their argument and calling them proabortion with how much they are pushing that option over others most prolife people lack the social understanding of not referencing their religion or i to support their stance it makes you wonder would they think the way they do if it wasnt for the bible because it didnt take a bible for me to think abortion should be heavily restricted both extreme sides of the isle is dangerous and does humankind injustice
532,imagine saying the us is the land of the free when everyone has their hand in pocket
533,abortion is healthcare
534,i thought the r word was gonna be retarded took me a whilewhoops
535,heres my opinion and frankly im astounded nobody mentions this fathers are equal parents they should not be forced into parenthood anymore than the woman should be women say they should be allowed abortions bcos they may not want to be parents well that should be true of men women say that the argument dont have sex if you dont want to get pregnant is sexist but its literally exactly the circumstance for men heres my opinion a woman should be allowed an abortion up to between <number> and <number> weeks at <number> weeks the baby has a <number> in <number> chance of living so maybe on the lower side of that there should be an exception right up until and including during the birth if it saves the life of either the mother or baby which is formalising already common practise in the instance of complications etc an abortion should be okd by <number> doctors as is practice in the uk in the instance of abortions happening during a birth for whatever immediate medically neccessary reason the doctor operating will make the decision and if that decision is wildly innapropriate then the doctor will face a tribunal again already common practice for any medical procedure however the father should have an equal say in the abortion meaning if either parent doesnt want the child then an abortion happens equal parents people weirdly object by saying that a woman should not be forced to have a procedure but the only <number> options open outside of this are the woman having an abortion of her own volition so the exact same procedure or the woman giving birth so a procedure involving the exact same area just massively more invasive but the exact same principle additionally abortion is a very quick and painless procedure and this doesnt compare to forcing a man into parenthood for the rest of his life and beyond it is worth mentioning i think that the most common cause of death of young men is suicide and the most common cause of death of pregnant women is homicide what all those happy expectant fathers just suddenly decided to kill their partner and future child fathers should have an equal say i think the main reasons that people dont even consider this are firstly that people dont want to tell women what to do not only with their bodies but in general so we see this in workplace dress codes for example but also that men are told and taught to be chivalrous and to not talk about mens issues even make fun of men that do
536,when is it ok to take an innocent life out of conveniency
537,i am actually prochoice but i am flabbergasted how carelessly people are dealing with that thing an abortion is an extremly difficult decision and it should be possible to have one but there should be very careful considerations about what you are doing the selfishness and thoughtlessnes the prochoicers display is just disgusting
538,i find that this prolife verses prochoice debate isnt about choice at all its an argument about where life starts if everyone just agreed that it was or wasnt murder then we could actually discuss this so personally i agree that abortion shouldnt be used as birth control obviously and i agree that abortion is murder but america has legalized killing in certain situations death row and selfdefense for example i commend any woman who shouldnt have a baby and does it anyway that takes a lot of personal sacrifice but im prochoice because i am nervous about what the government will start forcing us to do with our bodies next vaccines maybe so i think i should get the option to get rid of my baby if the condom ripped or i was red or there was an accident or whatever additionally before roe v wade college students would be rolled out of their dorms after weekends because of selfadministered abortions that resulted in many deaths there were backalley doctors women would shove coat hangers up there to try killing the child resulting in tearing and internal bleeding if abortion is illegal i fear that this is going to happen again im unsure if i would get an abortion myself i hope that i intend to get pregnant when i do but i definitely want that safety net and the buffer between personal rights and the gov is always nice anyone open to debate
539,both are so contradictoryi think the hope honestly is just to have less aboration you can never get rid of it but you can lessen the pain
540,how could she say shes christian then say they should have a choice
541,i personally take kinda both side what i mean is that i think abortion is justified and must be if its a kid by kid i mean under <number> rape first oopsie the other unless someone give me a good reason that i missed not really and if my opinion is wrong that understable im myself still a kid
542,so if i shot your heart i wouldt be murding as i was just killing a lump of cells no and so what if thats inside someone elses skin they made a choice now they suffer the pain and joy over motherhood
543,the religious guy really didnt help the prolife argument in this video and im both prolife and religious
544,i feel as though this is a very black and white issue actually it makes me so incredibly angry to listen to those who say its not it should always be a choice i respect the prolife ideology so much but ending abortion creates more harm than good
545,why is the abortion decisio0n difficult and respect the women if it is just a clump of cells wtf is the problem with removing them it should be emotionless if i had an abcess or a cyst i would want it removed the cyst may have been in me but wasnt a human life
546,i hate this conversation man have absolutely no say in whether a women wants the baby or not but a women have the choice to let a man be <number> a burdon of fatherhood how does this make sens red pill anyone i live in belgium where abortion is allowed till <number> weeks and stand behind this law if you dont want the baby a woman can chose to donate the baby to a famely that wants a baby even tho a man doesnt have that same optionand a woman can chose not to tell the man its egotistical to think that you can kill a human live till the moment of birth whats the line after birth i question my body my right is the most ridiculous statement ever once you make the choice of heving sex getting an unplanned pregnancy is no longer your body you decide off i firmly believe that my right stops where yours begin <number> weeks is where a fetus right start
547,these whole issue could be solve by banning sexbaby making no gay sex etc sure not until they are married and allowing abortions only to r casesproven with r kit tests and incests those are the marginal cases always being used by pro choice people sex is not like water air food etc you can live with out it or control your urges
548,people who say what if they got the rword by someone and that they should be able to do abortion doesnt make much sense when you think about it for a bit why should the soon to be born baby who hasnt even got the opportunity to experience life to be killed because someone without consent gave you this responsibility the person who did this deserved the punish they deserve but the unborn baby has to die also it takes two people to make a baby both deserves to be responsible over the babies life as that baby if half of the mom and half of the dad as abortion doesnt only affect the mother but the father as well i understand what woman would push on that they have to do more work in giving birth to the baby but that doesnt dismiss that the fathers role of providing for his woman and soon to be born child additionally half of that baby came form you guessed it from him so men deserve to eb in this conversation just a much as the mother has to as well because as adults it was their choice to have a child so its their responsibility over the childs life
549,<number><number> exactly
550,tryna take away peoples right to choose when their choice has no affect on you at all is wrong
551,i dont get why not accepting others kill literal babies inside the womb is a religious argument unless prochoice want to say that only thanks to religion god etc killing was decided to be bad i bet they would not agree with that
552,when you made fun about that guy it wasnt nice man idc what you think about the topic it simply wasnt a nice thing to do
553,you say you want to be impartial but your constantly making fun of the prolife dude who by the way speaks the truth
554,i like how the lesbian chick looks like michael reeves
555,how is this still a topic
556,bruh theyre adults and should be held accountable for the baby they made with sex comes the possibility of pregnancy its understandable that victims of r want to abort and should have that option
557,i dont see any difference between murder and abortion no matter how many arguments i hear
558,its so crazy that men shouldnt have equal day on womens bodies but yet women have the same rights as men and they arent even required to go to war
559,one thing i must say if life begins at conception than all cismen are actually transgender by that logic all human individualswhether they have an xx an xy or an atypical sex chromosome combinationbegin development from the same starting point during early development the gonads of the fetus remain undifferentiated that is all fetal genitalia are the same and are phenotypically female
560,to be fair most people who say abortion is murder dont have kids most people you askt looked like they dont know what kids mean i dont have kids to but my sister and a good female friend has one and they are often stressed out af so i said after witnessing this nope no kids for me my life is over with kids so females should have the permission to do what they want and sience says it is ok they dont feel anything but that is the problem with humans they are the victims of there belives and agenda and brainwashing comming from how they get raised we should think about this more ice cold and put feelings by the side and focus on facts then there are cases of rpe i know on girl who got a kid from that and she never wanted it she keept it at the end but other women dont want that shout they have a kid running arround them forcing them to remeber that day for the rest of there life sorry but no logic says and normal common human sense let anybody have a choice and dont judge people let them have there life and pro life people stop beeing selfish no one forces you to do it first think then act but your feelings to the side and think about this for more then just a handfull of minutes
561,im proposing a third way there are good reasons to have an abortion and bad reasons to have an abortion
562,people having abortions should definitely not be demonized but with the media and social media now it almost feels like abortions are being celebrtaed people brag about it which is so fucking sick
563,i am pro life i am also not cristian abortion is not morally right even if you have the abortion before there is a heartbeat you are still giving the opportunity for life and then taking it away that is like telling someone you can give them money if they want they say yes and then you turn around and say actually na
564,yes i waited to have sex till i got married
565,at the end of the day we all know that the responsibility of raising a child ends up on the moms head if yall really cared about human life you would think about whats gonna happen to the girl thats standing before you whats gonna happen to her will she be okay no none of them care because its not their responsibility they wanna get laid but afterward they can just go get some milk by the way late term abortions mainly occur because thats when a doctor finds out that there is something wrong with the baby abortions also occur when you find out a chromosome problem in the child can you raise a child with a chromosome problem maybe some people can but for some no not everyone wants to bring an unhealthy child into the world and imagine if you get raped fuck youre gonna make that girl carry a baby for <number> months and raise it what about school what about her life none of yall care and for you people who are gonna say adoption have you seen the foster care system like oh my god this world is survival of the fittest if you know you will suffer as a result of your offspring then the logical thing to do is to not have that offspring
566,yo gen im glad your mom and dad were pro life otherwise we wouldnt have good content all these poeple were given the opportunity of life but were they worthy they push death while living ironic
567,<number><number> what
568,just saying its your body is a nonsensical argument then why cant i murder someone or walk outside naked without getting arrested because the law deems it illegal so if the law says so you shouldnt find an excuse for it of course every law should have exceptions in case of rape or sickle cell patients should they choose to abort
569,killing children is wronghow did we even get to this point in society
570,ok so opinions aside on this topic the guy at <number><number> really needs sleep more his eyes are so sunken
571,pro choice my body my choice yes youre body your choice not to have unprotected sex in the first person and those who say the father have no say in their body should not ask for child support because they have no say in their money
572,i dont care wat anyone has to say but in my opinion under the right circumstances i support abortion <number> but its funny why women think men dont have a say when it comes to taking an abortion its just sad they want to be acknowledged in this modern time by downgrading men
573,wait why didnt you post the video if shes on public street you dont need consent form her unless you didnt want to post it which is totally fine
574,no way they are saying r is ok
575,no way they are saying r is ok
576,the best is to be illegal untill a certain point you cant just decided you want an abortion when you about to give birth wild example
577,if a man doesnt have a say in his child then a woman doesnt have say in the mans income
578,pro choice question for pro lifes you say its killing a human what if the mother dies from the baby you know mother still has a whole life and the fetus never had a breath of air pro life question for pro choice if you can kill babies bc their not alive then can you kill a person on life support
579,men are affected by the decision not to abort when they have to pay for child support by law homie said contraception is cheap blah blah blah insurance doesnt even cover it
580,rape should be an exception along with health complications toward the baby or mother
581,the roe v wade was not ruled the rights to abortion it was ruled the rights of the privacy between a doctor and their patient people get that monument federal court ruling abortion was just a beneficiary of that ruling democrats had five decades to codify that ruling in <number> obama ran on that promise when he first ran promised once he got elected his first act was to codify it and once elected he announced he wouldnt be doing such during his first four years he had the perfect chance to do such the democrats held majority in every way to get it to pass but they and he didnt dont blame the current ruling but those whom failed you for several decades your party failed you
582,the problem with abortion being a human right is the belief you have the right to force others to kill an unborn child
583,what good does abortion do for humanity i get individual rights but we serve a bigger purpose than aborting fetuses i personally dont think it should be completely illegal but it should be legal where women are just having abortions every <number> months at some point we should be watching them as psychopaths id like to think that there are safe and reliable preventative methods so we wouldnt have to have this conversation
584,i think my body my choice is a silly argument because the abortion is done to the fetus not to the mothers body but im prochoice because as much as prolifers might insist otherwise the morality of abortion is not so clear cut prolifers tend to assume that a new person comes into existence at the moment of conception but this is ultimately just an assumption and no one really knows when the blob of cells actually develops a mind and when there isnt a societal consensus the weight of the moral decision should be left to the individual
585,if it was the womans body she would not be alive after the procedure
586,i dont think these people understand that healthcare isnt a right
587,prolife here go ahead and hate me
588,in my opinion if you can kill it then its alive
589,in my opinion abortion is a right the life of a woman is more important than the life of a theoretical human beeing which isnt even born yet i dont care about any religious reasonings
590,my body my choice doesnt make sense the baby isnt a part of their body
591,but killing innocent human beings is a human right
592,no i just gotta pay <number> years worth of child support without say
593,id be hard pressed to say that if abortion is murder then vilification of that person is a cop out consistency is a foundation of thought if a person kills another because they are a killer and you vilify them then based on that its a cop out youd have to sympathize with the killer and his lived experiences so you can understand what brought them to it but would it make it right youd have to empathize with a non empath who might consider murdering you over nothing its based on societal standards you cant take a dump on someones car without shame then you cant murder without vilification even if society changes to accept the opposite it doesnt make it correct
594,i love that we heard both sides but you didnt show any pro life womens opinions
595,so i assume you lean more towards prochoice given the amount of edits on prolifers it shows a clear bias if youre trying to show a middle ground
596,okay to the man who said wed have <number> million more people holy wow we are already way overpopulated you really want that many more people eating our resources
597,the r word i am a mother and my older two children have autism my second born child has a lot of defects they both are a blessing in mine and my husband life for you to say or implie that people who are not normal their life isnt a gift thats gross you ask my children if they want to live they would say yeswhen youre pregnant it a totally different person inside your body its not your body youre killing somebody they have their own unique dna and even have personalities in the womb its barbaric to take an infant and crush their skull and rip the limbs off of them because they are inconvenient what if your parents decided you werent a person and while you slept peacefully in your room the grabbed a mechanical vice and crushed your head until it popped that would be murder it doesnt matter the location or the size of the human that makes it murder its the action of voluntarily taking another persons life and when we go and try to define when personhood starts we could end up with a society who ends up killing already born children up to the age of <number> with what some pro choice scientists argue that they dont have the metal capacity to know they are alive and wont remember that time in their life nobody should ever be discriminated against based on size age or mental capacity
598,dude you didnt ask none of these people the correct questions and none of these people in the video are uneducated on this issue
599,i think abortion should be choice however i also believe its cough murder cough i mean not moral
600,how come nobody considers wearing a condom or birth control an abortion there would be a baby but you stopped it from living how is that not murder
601,abortion is the killing of a living child no mother has the right to murder her own child this is not choice its murder
602,a lot of people take for granted that abortion is killing a person and killing a person is bad but why is it bad i agree a lot with the ideas of peter singer and i think the value of a life comes from the happiness experienced through it and provoked by it that means that i would rather kill a parentless child that no one would miss than the family dog because people would be sad for the dog now lets take these ideas for abortion bringing an unwanted kid to life is not in favor of happiness both the child and the parents will potentially be unhappy about their life while killing the foetus will just take a weight off of the mothers chest and womb killing a baby is sometimes the right and moral choice to do also what is the problem with prolife people other people aborting does not have any effect on their life thus going in the street to protest against it is wild how petty are you do you think youre going to heaven for harassing women
603,i can understand the pro life stance but i dont understand how its often tangled up with pro gun
604,im pro choice because at the end of the day its your body and you have to live with the consequences i absolutely despise when people pick and choose parts of their religion to benefit the their should be a clear separation between church and state i think that one the baby has a heartbeat thats is a human being which should not be allowed to be aborted i personally wouldnt get an ablation but that doesnt mean i need to stop someone else from doing it the country should have no laws over your body
605,an abortion its the last and worst case for a women and only in emergency to save the womans life or repe or abuse of a minor should it be allowed only in this three reasons is it expected logically truthfully
606,i was gonna comment he was a virgin and im not disappointed
607,my opinion if a woman got rped then an abortion is ok if the womans life is threatened by giving birth then an abortion is ok but if you had unsafe sex then its your fault because even if you had safe sex there is still a chance that the condom breaks or something and the man and the woman are having the responsibility that they dont get kids when they risk it and if you feel old enough to have sex at <number> you should feel old enough to carry the responsibility of getting a kid
608,good video but unjust for making fun of that guy
609,i guess murder is a human right now
610,i dont know how to feel about some men celebrating this like jesus empathy = <number>
611,if you doing this again ask about male contraception
612,you shouldnt have laughed at that guys perspective it goes against the point of this video
613,i support bodily autonomy for abortion and the vaccine but if you refuse to get vaccinated you have to stay in your house and not endanger other people i also support your personal choice to be a nudist in your own home or with other nudists but not in public
614,<number><number> well hes right about one thing
615,the whole argument on cutoff point is stupid you are basically asking how much am i allowed to to wait before ending a life the truth is no matter what time you do it is more or less moral it isnt about the time its about the reason
616,if you dont wonna a baby have safe sexe just like that guy said <number> true
617,i feel like i lost brain cells listening to their rationalizations especially on the pro life side
618,theres a reason why its called pregnancy because life is growing inside these are such superficial questions some questions are good but you dont get to the point why woman becomes pregnant because she spread her legs to whoever what does murder do mentally it destroysa person man and woman maybe not right away because teenagers and they dont thinkbut itll come back for them later in life men choose who you sleep with because you dont want woman deciding wheter your child should live or die just because said woman is a ho they call it life in those artifical cliniqsno when sperm ferilizes an egg someone said in your interview adoption is the best way to go about itbut does he get it thatif theres an abortion theres no baby
619,men should not have a say so at the end of the day the woman is the one that is responsible for that child if they choose to have it so its a womans choice to do what is best for them and their life
620,kicked someone down a staircase it is my fault and my responsibility it may have been hilarious and fun at first butunfortunately i had to pay for his medical fees as he broke a leg thankfully i am a woman and he was a burden on my life i was financially unstable and mentally unprepared for the cost of his medical bill so i could abort him
621,its so pathetic to me that the argument is about womans rights it has zero to do with women its about the potential life youre destroying and all of the people that life would touch as a woman you need to be responsible for making sure men wear condoms if they want to have sex with you and as a man you should make sure to always have condoms on you when anticipating a possible sexual encounter once my fiance and i had a partial miscarriage that needed a partial abortion to remove the rest of the fetus i realized how very real the life is before that happened we had all the dreams of the potential that was to come those dreams were snuffed out that day if you get pregnant for being irresponsible with your body and your choices you should have to deal with the consequences
622,the people you got for this video didnt really contribute to an intellectual and multi faceted issue there was not much intelligence there wish to see another video concerning this topic in the future thats a little more serious
623,r u pro choice kk r u for or against capital punishment
624,that sarcastic man is such a beta
625,the heart actually starts beating at day <number>
626,i fail to undestand why would you make fun out one of the guys who answered to you in good faith even twice dont do this interviews if you cant do it with respect
627,pro choice cause these pro life people are speaking from inside of bubble as if everyone has happy ending lives like no thats not how it works i like how they talk about orphanages and shit but i bet they never stepped foot into one
628,pro life for the win
629,i see abortion as murder but even at best its pure selfishness when you dont care about a babies life because it will interfere with your life that is being completely selfish the main thing is that abortion shouldnt be used as birth control anyone can make a mistake but when you go back for a 2nd abortion its became about you not caring
630,killing another human is a human right ok bang
631,lol pro choice as a queer woman how exactly will she ever have a choice in her relationships
632,murder and r ape should be legal too f it no laws
633,pro my choice
634,im provac and prolife we all have responsibility to our society if you dont believe that you do then you should make your own house grow your own crops and harvest them and turn them into a food and make everything yourself and stop relying to others humans are social animals thats one big advantage we have that enabled us to prosper you have the choice to be a lonewolf but affecting the immunosuppressed people by not having a vaccine and killing an innocent child inside a womb is wrong you are exercising your rights in the expense of the rights of other human beings
635,to say mens bodys arent effected during pregnancy is crazy to say so the mans brain isnt part of his body doe he not go thru a bit of stress when taking care of the mother while shes caring the baby for <number> months sometimes longer depending on the mother and babies recovery rate such selfish thought process pregnancy is tough on both genders in many different ways if men were the ones who carried babies woman would be pissed they had no control over whether or not their child gets to live
636,clearly abortion should before the first trimester
637,its a baby im against murdering babies theres no further nuance required
638,contraception begins with accountability
639,right so men should just shut up but also pay me child support
640,the queen identifying person said that they men shouldnt have a say to what happens to another persons body so then should women have the same right when making a decision for the fetus inside them
641,also if a bunch of cells is a life so is my throat cancer i will thus leave it be cause im not a murderer
642,acting like people have absolute control over their bodies isnt liberaterian its anarchism when you say homicide or theft is against the law youre prohibiting people to use their body to harm another humans not taking a vaccine doesnt even stop the spread and if they other person is vacced it wont kill them on the other hand abortion <number> of the time ends up killing a baby we need to pick and choose which liberties have to be protected and which liberty makes us less free
643,abortion and vaccination can not be compared altough i very strongly supoort vaccination if one scenario your are killing a human being in the other case your deciding to not protect yourself
644,grape
645,murderer says what
646,the guy at the beginning im sorry but this country is a 3rd world country acting like a 1st world country
647,how about we shut up about stupid issues like this there are way more things that are going on that need more attention not saying it isnt a legitimate issue but can we pause this while we have a debt crisis going on we can argue about this when we have the time
648,whats the r word
649,my stance is if u get r worded then u can get an abortion otherwise no no no
650,its very sad but true that men shouldnt have a say in whether or not women are able to get abortions because there are men who tried to baby trap them and they are women who are stuck in abusive situations and when they escape certification a man especially a man who abused them should not be allowed to make say on whether or not she keeps said child or if a rape victim ends up getting pregnant are they gonna ask the convicted rapist if he wants to keep the child
651,<number><number> there are over <number> million brothers and sisters in the us right now i dont see you hanging out with or making memories with all of them why dont you stop getting so fixated on the those sixty million embryos but rather the people alive right now
652,<number><number> is on point
653,<number><number> he looks like if hasan wasnt a horrible person
654,another way is saying are you antiprochoice kk but you are for the death penalty
655,whats the r word
656,its not easy personal circumstances differ from person to person the answer cannot be generalised to fit all situations
657,abortion is a human right for those werent aborted
658,it is a shame because it seemed as you intentionally made fun of the guy who talks about that since roe and wade <number> million babies were abortedkilled he is right and has good moral stance it is a shame to make fun on him
659,he aint carrying the child
660,that was so not funny what that clown said about guns and kids u should get a huuuge strike just for that alone
661,all i know is that guy in the floral shirt is awesome and i would like to be his friend
662,my take even though no one cares abortion is definitely immoral and contraceptives should be used but its needed in a world of bad economics sexual assaults over population and a society obsessed with sex its easy for someone who came from a good upbringing to preach prolife they have no idea how bad life can be the reality is some lives are not worth living
663,<number><number> ik that was a joke but
664,abortion to me is murder im always gunna stick with that
665,you should of asked pro life women were generally more passionate and open about killing fetuses then pro life men
666,adoption in america will cost you at least <number> dollars and that is the cheap side so no abortion and expensive adoption makeitmakesense
667,bashahahahahaha my <number> million brothers and sisters
668,why are all of these people drunk haha
669,these christians men need to stop
670,cool cool
671,the body argument is weak af so should a pregnant woman drink alcohol and smoke cigarettes because its her body youre serving yourself and in that process youre ending a life thats it none of my views are affected by religious idealogies btw im not religious at all im just frustrated at the fact that its a fetus thatll be a person in <number> months do whatever you want but dont say its not ending a life cause it is
672,tell them pro abortion no pro choicce
673,what is the r word
674,some of these people are washed i swear xd including both sides murica fascinating
675,bet deleted shows everything except her face
676,you say you want to be unbiased but you poke fun at the pro life guy when hes being compassionate
677,dyson make great abortion tools
678,david chapelle nailed it bigtime women shouldnt be said what to do with their bodys so neither men shouldnt be obligated to affectt their walletschild support
679,a choice for everyone but the baby nothing dead grows so its alive repent
680,if you have an abortion there is definitely a mark on your sole not sure you can go anywhere but hell some sins are worse than others
681,shoot even school children he should go to jail simple
682,america todays babylon
683,great video i think it shows both sides pretty well im prolife and while i understand that women do have a right to their body at some point you have to realize that a fetus is a different body the phrase my body my choice doesnt even make any sense because its not your body you made the choice when you decided to have sex
684,its about whats a priority like they always say be strong take tough decisions abortion is murder but thats a necessary evil like many other things and youre not affecting anyone with your abortion so its different from vaccines
685,agressor
686,wtf ppl all around
687,idk man a lot of people have wished they were never born circumstances where their conception was a selfish act of their parents as a living being you dont have the right to die without it being selfish in some way or all it has major consequences for the spirit and the community one is born into there certainly is a lot to discuss
688,b
689,its about the fetus rights girl be fr a fetus does not have any right
690,idk isnt it ur fault for getting pregnent though unless its r word
691,abortion is not a human right the life of this human living being is a human right
692,fathers not having a say is so stupid
693,pro both
694,i think men should have the choice if the women should kill it or not because why not what if he wants the kid and hes fine taking care of it thats ok that my body my choice shit is dumb because yes but still that man will have a kid that your going to kill why kill that if the guy is willing to care of it
695,religion video we should respect others belives this video brothers and sisters hahaha that is inconsistensy on your part too
696,you speaking to a lot of drunks
697,loool lets go gen
698,this is not one of your best videos usually you are very impartial did not seem like it in this one the reason this videos are so attracting is trying not to be bias
699,its a tribal issue
700,pro life made better argument than pro choice maybe you couldve been less bias dide
701,<number><number> the mans body is not effectedthats why he shouldnt have a saying in the decision maybe his body is not effected by that decision but it still effects him just like for example his wife harming herself to the point of death or close would effect him in that example he isnt physically effect but psychologically even though it might come with physical effects afterwardsi dont know not an expert in that field but it doesnt really matter anyway
702,i love your content but this is the first video ive given a dislike reason was for mocking your interviewees
703,i like your videos but why did you laughed thats rude
704,whats interesting is that most american states have double triple and more the amount of time to abort a fetus than in europe as a european i think abortion should ne limited a lot more in the us but i am also pro abortion also the father should have some say bc in many countries he has to pay a lot of money to his child just bc he is a parent
705,when talk about abortion everyone know how cruel that is to literally terminate someone process of living both pro choice and life have their own agenda about this and thats why i dont give any shit about their opinion
706,let the babies live you barbarians lol
707,after <number> weeks a foetus is clompleted and even has fingernails
708,just because you have a tumor doesnt mean you have the right to get chemo
709,the thing that makes me go on the pro life side is that all that will end up impacting our society a lot and i dont want a society based on the lack of responsability and morality
710,there should be a new political side one only for logic people needs to pass a logic and reasons exam to get in no religious bs
711,damn lmao
712,i do tend to be pro life and think that just because you werent responsible enough to understand that intercourse may lead to a pregnancy that indicates that youre not a fully developed adult that has a grasp of this world but in the same time i agree that abortion is accepted in the case of a grape but if youre drunk in a bar and you woke up next day with a dude next to you and you later find out that youre pregnant that just means you were irresponsible and a potential life shouldnt be accountable for your promiscuous behaviour moreover the law already holds men accountable if they sleep with women and get them pregnant but women are not held accountable for the life that they took
713,im prochoice and i like to make up hypothetical scenarios to explore the mindset of people by seeing how they answer that scenario so heres the thing prolife support the idea that every fetus has the right to be born i understand that viewpoint that for them every life is sacred but is every life sacred lets say you could see into the future that this fetus will grow up to be a vile and horrible person maybe they be responsible for a horrible trauma for a student because they were an asshole bully or maybe even worse become the reason a world war happens or even a dictator would you still allow the kid to be born this happen or to put it more bluntly to question the idea of every fetus should be born would you allow the abortion of a horrible person like say hitler obviously its a silly hypothetical scenario but thats why i ask what if anyone who answers this question honestly and doesnt push it away with this is stupid and unrealistic and would never happen will appear to me as an intelligent person one can have a discussion with to push the same question on me lets say i had a wife and we aborted a kid but then we get flung into the past and shown a vision that my child will become the next jesus the next mr rogers in general my child will become a blessing to the entire world and get rewarded some worldpeace medal would i still want to abort it well if this vision is telling the truth i really would have second doubts if my child really would make the world a better place i would sit down and think if maybe i should give birth a chance only problem with my version is prochoice is the choice to have an abortion while prolife is against having abortion at all my scenario would make more sense if my side would be against birth abortion only
714,brudda
715,if it is about womens rights why didnt they use their rights to not use contraception why did they choose to sleep with someone they didnt want to create a new life with
716,lol
717,it doesnt what view you take the objective view is what is the primary purpose of sex the primary purpose of sex is to reproduce that is my sec organs are called reproductive organs biology doesnt care how a person uses sex biology will function as it is supposed to therefore a person says with their actions they want to create a new life we can discuss rape however prochoice people dont care about rape victims they only mentioned rape victims so abortion can be universal for all the states that restricted abortion also made an exception for rape victims but they are not satisfied with that
718,ugh idk idk idk idk
719,even though i have sinned of fornication i was once a virgin so was my girlfriend rip we both had sex one time and that was the only time after that we did repent and never had sex ever again when she lost her life in a hit and run on february <number> <number> thats when i pledged celibacy ive been celibate for <number> years now ppl who have sinned of fornication can always repent but those who end the lives of unborn babies are just murderers and god doesnt have kind words for murderers god hates hands that shed innocent blood according to proverbs <number><number>
720,i would hope the pro abortion choice group would just be straight by saying the fetus is human life we know but the moms basic convenience is more important you need not bring up the <number><number> of one per cent rape and incest because it doesnt matter to you most you would allow abortion up to nine months if others had to have one you wont give an inch because you are afaid the pro lovelife side will use that as a new baseline to limit taking a fetus life
721,asain sneako
722,man i usually love your videos but i dont think its cool to laugh at people as a journalist
723,you still have the right to choose if you want to get vaccinated but you have to live with the consequences
724,being prolife shouldnt be about religion for humans at the most fundamental level it is about valuing life something we do not do enough of it is about the way we see our offspring are we really so selfish that we believe in terminating life simply because it is inconvenient yes yes we are and to me that is whats very sad
725,its sad you didnt talk to a prolife woman
726,i liked what you were doing until you started mocking the people youre supposed to be interviewing
727,the problem is that after the spring has sprung after consent was given and the deed was done you cant then withdraw consent this is a huge issue with society
728,the man isnt affected by a child he created or child that was aborted what about that love he has for that child before its even born and youre just going to up and aboard it that affects the father of that child many people as soon as they find out their wife is pregnant and when a woman finds out shes pregnant the love for their child is an immediate feeling we love that child already it would hurt him if she aborted it and he wanted it it will hurt her in the long run and many women regret it but many will get another one
729,you missed a major question for people that say my body my choice when they tell you no one has the right to tell me what to do with my body ask them about drug laws not many people out there protesting for the right to smoke crack
730,disliked really disliked you having a bias stance during the interviewing laughing at certain answers
731,i am pro life and i am not a fan of some of the pro choice advocates bc they preach empathy and kindness but dont show it to others to the pro choice people it irritates me that they arent willing to listen another perspective and yet they say other people are closed minded also i believe that the father should vocalize their opinion and get a say the woman should consider his opinion too it doesnt matter if it doesnt affect their bodies thats not the point it takes too
732,yes its morally wrong to commit abortion but i support it that that right there is why i weep for our societys future when people of that society support something they know is wrong where does it end or does it
733,avoid critical thought definition of the liberal party
734,men are forced to pay for child support for that child by lawif the mother decides to keep the baby so its only fare that men should have an equal say too
735,interviewer laughing and giggling at stoic moments turned me off no subscribe
736,genocide
737,the mandate is selfish but a woman who ends her own childs life in the womb isnt selfish this is called broken logic
738,the issue of abortion is not a cause but rather a symptom of failed sex relationship jordan peterson
739,great video i dont know why you mocked that prolife guy tho he was making valid points
740,this is probably the first time i disliked a video how you stop the whole point in the middle of the video many times to make fun of christian values kind of hypocritical do better
741,people keep calling for an open mind when in reality there is no such thing in this debate they want a mind that can be changed im pro choice and there is nothing i have heard thats changed my mind from it especially when the people who are forced birth dont listen either i am also the type of person who would dump aborted clumps of cells on that dude who said children are a gift from god just to watch him scream those people dont and wont get it reason cant be had here
742,but i think you are pro choice seeing that you mocked the one who is pro life when he said he might have <number> million brothers and sisters that i make memories with but i hope you are pro life but anyways very nice video 35k squad eyy
743,pro life people always have better and more compelling points also theyre usually the most responsible ones
744,americans lmao
745,just something i read a year ago if you only allow abortion when people are raped then that means you will only recognize their rights when its already been violated fetus rights right its horrific how these people will recognize a fetus rights but not even reconsider the rights of the woman in front of them when you have the time to fight to make abortion illegal then its clear that you have the capability to fight to make the alternatives to it accessible as well critic the healthcare system fight for adoption foster care and for the quality of life we are no longer arguing over an old morality dillema this is not a debate to convince ourselves we are morally better than the other if you reason that life begins at conception you should also understand that the responsibility of taking care of life does not end when its been born when someone chooses to raise a child they choose to sacrifice a piece of themselves which cannot be defined by our mere opinions when you think fetuses are only a clump of cells make sure you also understand that you were once the same as them the only difference is now you have the choice to consider it life or not whether you are prolife or prochoice your opinion cannot go beyond the borders of someones body make sure your motives are pure because i know that most of the time this is not really about life this is about women being forced the responsibility to bear it if you cared for life im sure you would be out there making effort for life to flourish not only here speaking about how you are good because you are moral
746,i dont understand people that are pro life it makes no sense for me to force a woman to be pregnant and life with a child the rest of her life but i still dont come after them what is wrong with people thanlfully i live in germany where abortion is allowed till week <number> even though the rules are really hard it was forbidden to say i do abortions and you can come to my clinic until the same day the us decided to forbid abortions
747,it is a third world country
748,the reason why im pro life is cause its better for children to suffer than dying and escaping hellearth
749,mans body isnt effected tell that to my bank balance and next <number> years of my life where i have to pay child support to the child that i didnt wanted and in many case also pay for his selfish mother
750,have all the abortions you want just create a registry all women having it should be identified so men can be advised before pursuing them this is a right and needs to be a law
751,you have a bad take and are a hypocrite
752,very biased video
753,my body my choice = embrace more free sex which is this the actual problem
754,also i was laughing with you at <number><number> because brooooo like if these guys were in the position of a woman or girl who was impregnanted not under her own will i bet you they would not be keeping the baby either like
755,how many raped actually want abortion how many say was rape so dont feel so bad just cause got pissed and cant remember doent make it rape unless a loonie feminist
756,nice how he acts like hes being neutral up until he starts making fun of a christian prolifer
757,when they breathe air but they breathe air in the womb
758,it depends on the girl if she had sex by her own than it shouldnt be done
759,i honestly think abortion should be allowed its just really complicated and people have different ideas on it if you dont want to get an abortion because you believe its unethical murder then do that if you want to do abortion because you dont want it or cant afford it etc then do it
760,prochoice is so absolutely disturbing when you truly think about it
761,there is really no issue here one hate life and one care life simple
762,i dont take this topic lightly its very complicated i would say im pro choice the story of kate cox a woman from texas who challenged her states abortion ban after doctors determined that her fetus was suffering from a lethal medical condition the states supreme court put the ruling on hold and she was forced to flee to new mexico where the procedure is legal cox couldnt wait any longer to get the procedure her health was on the line continuing the pregnancy put her at risk of severe complications that threaten her life and future fertility a state shouldnt have the power to determine reproductive freedom
763,these ppl get on my nerves if they can choose whether to kill the baby the man should be able to choose to not support the baby
764,so a man shouldnt have a say if she wants an abortion so why should he pay child support
765,men should not talk about abortion where does sperm cell coming from thou from male people tf
766,not men having opinions
